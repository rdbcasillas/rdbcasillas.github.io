With the advent of computers, medical technology has drastically transformed the ability of medical researchers to decode the human body. We not only have amassed details that were unthinkable in 1980s,  our interactions with these computers to better understand the human body have become so simple that even someone without a medical degree can learn to have these interactions. 

A discipline that has given us a lot of this progress in recent years is Bioinformatics. If I have to give one sentence summary of what this field is, it would be : The unpacking of the ambiguous relationships between genes (or proteins) and phenotypical effects of these genes that we observe in animals. But I should add a caveat. No short sentence summary can do any justice to the plethora of information that forms a particular discipline. This is especially true of Bioinformatics as the work involved spans across disciplines in Computer Science and Biology.

Imagine a disease X. Its a terrible disease that causes thousands of deaths every year. Its inherited, so we know that unfortunate genetics are the primary cause of it. How would you go about finding those genetic components? Look at the genes of course! But which gene? And where exactly inside that gene? And what exactly to look for in that gene that would tell you something is odd? What makes something in the gene look odd? 

These are one set of questions that Bioinformatics is consistently tackling. There are two kinds of
"Bioinformaticians" in this world. One kind, tries to create tools that help in converting the biological molecules (like RNA and DNA) into computer readable format in the form of "ATCG". This kind also writes various computer algorithms that aid in "reading" and "mining" these computer readable genetic elements. 

Once you have these genetic elements in your computer, they become pieces of data in a file like any other data (for example the contents of this article). Manipulation of this data is what the other kind of  Bioinformaticians do to gain insight into possible patterns that may be present in a person's genome. It could be a pattern that symbolises a Cancer patient or a pattern that highlights mutations in a person suffering from Alzheimers disease. 

I am a Bioinformatician and among other things my job is to find patterns in the genomes of patients suffering from blood related diseases. My findings of a particular mutation or lack of an important piece of a gene can help clinicians address that defect by attacking the problem at its core. It also helps physicians to better understand the disease and explain to their patients the root cause of the disease. 

Lets take an example which is overly simplified but it get the point across. Suppose a patient with diabetes gets their genome sequenced. The purpose is of course to find the patterns that will help us answer the question : what does "diabetes" really mean at the genetic level? Once you have the genome sequenced and stored in a file for the computeres to read, Bioinformaticians will do their analysis on this "genome file" and compare it with a healthy person's "genome file". You can compare the whole genome but that would be unproductive as some chromosomes will be irrelevant to diabetes. This filtered focus on specific regions (genes) helps in performing a detailed comparison and figure out what diabetes looks like at the level of genetics. Is there a mutation from "A" to "G"? Is a region of 50 bases completely missing from a gene (deletion) or is there an extra set of 10 bases (insertion)? These changes would be reflected downstream  in the nature of protein that is coded by this region. And if another diabetic patient's genome file shows similar genetic patterns and similar genetic differences from a healthy patient's genome file, then we would have found a potential region that can be targeted to treat diabetes. 

Although my example only focused on changes in genes, Bioinformaticians also focus on changes in protein folding, epigenetic changes like methylation and even discovering connections between multiple genes that regulate together. Animal bodies are immensely complex and this complexity translates into large digital datasets. This is why you need skills in computer programming to be able to scan through all this data and find the relevant bits. 

Advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in the last decade has accelerated progress in the fields of Biology and Bioinformatics. The technology has been consistently dropping in price which is making it more prevalent. To appreciate this fact, one only needs to look at this graph: 



Some of the applications of NGS are like the ones I talked above. But more recently, there has been quite a lot of excitement over precision medicine. In 2015, USA's president Barack Obama launched a Precision Medicine Initiative. White House's website explains:

> Until now, most medical treatments have been designed for the “average patient.” As a result of this “one-size-fits-all” approach, treatments can be very successful for some patients but not for others. Precision Medicine, on the other hand, is an innovative approach that takes into account individual differences in people’s genes, environments, and lifestyles. 

The results from this approach can only come
