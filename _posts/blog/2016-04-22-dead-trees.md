Have been observing dead trees for past couple of weeks. Something beautiful in their plainness. The branches give an impression
of intricate patterns in our lungs. Street lamps in the background make the trees with hundreds of branches look 
like barbed wires. Unlike summer and Fall, the moon doesn't get 
to hide behind them and instead produces a spectacular sight 
especially if its passing a branch that happens to have a 
squirrel standing on it. Cloudy or clear, the color of the 
morning sky in their background allows me to appreciate different
shades of blue even more. They seem depressed but that's just
our cultural stereotypes associated with them. Look at them
with a fresh set of eyes. Look at them long enough. If they still
bore you, get a new of set of eyes. 

They are coming back to life now and as much as I welcome the 
change in weather, I will certainly miss watching them naked.
