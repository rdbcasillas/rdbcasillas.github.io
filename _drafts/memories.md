###Recreating snapshots of past using "transhuman memory"

The following idea assumes that we have solved the [Hard Problem of Concsciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) X years from now where I predict X to be approximately >50 years. Even if that prediction is true, I still feel its one of those science fiction ideas that has very low probability of coming true. My understanding of how memories work is super limited and I will naturally make embarrassing assumptions along the way which would be easily discarded by someone studying memory. But its fun to think about anyway.

When I talk about recreating past, it is not the whole sequence of events, its snapshots from that event. Basically like different frames from a movie. With better virtual reality techniques, we might fill the gaps and add more elements in the environment to give an illusion of the past, but it will largely be fake. I would rather have decent stand alone snapshots than have those snapshots being part of a fake virtual reality.  

Imagine an event that happened in your past that involved some other human being. So if you went for camping, imagine the ones where there were other people around you storing similar memories of that camping trip. We are focusing on recreating few moments out of that trip. The quality of the snapshot increases with the increase in the number of humans involved in that trip because we have more memories to work with. Now, human memory is largely shitty. But [memory consolidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation) does happen and those are the memories you would want to focus on. Plus, we can only create the events that we believe actually happened. If my friend cannot remember a single thing from the camping trip and even denies that he went to any such trip, the whole idea falls embarassingly. We don't have enough data to work with. So lets assume that she does remember it. We basically hook the brains to whatever machines we will be using at the time to observe the [Qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia) and notice the faint subjetive recreation in multiple brains involved in that event. Its almost like trying to get a better panaromic picture by taking pictures of a single object in the space from different angles. 

Its important to note that other subjects are important also because they play a role in creating your own image associated with that event. You are not storing yourself when you are storing these memories. Although its probably much better to just throw your image through captured pictures of you from that era than trusting someone else's image of you from that era. 

Other than recreating such a memory snapshot, this tool would also stimulate the brain with relevant "keywords" to demand for more information, especially when available data isn't good enough to capture the snapshots. We have all experienced that forgotten memories can resurface again if stimulated with right mix of ideas. This can happen even with events that happened a decade ago that you never thought of during the decade. This tools will have to use this strength of human memory to try and simulate as much info as it can. These keywords can be as simple as showing images of the camping place or asking the subjects questions relevant to that event. We will definitely have a near perfect understanding of how memories are stored. So assuming an understanding of what kind of questions can reignite the lost memories doesn't seem like a stretch.
