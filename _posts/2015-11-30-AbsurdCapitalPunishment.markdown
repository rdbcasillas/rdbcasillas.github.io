title: "Absurdity of Capital Punishment"

---


Over the course of this article, I will dispute most common arguments for death penalty, then consider few scenarios where death penalty might make sense and finally say a few words on what I think should happen with perpetrators of Delhi rape. 

Over the history of justice systems in various human societies, death penalty has played a consistent role. Its hard not to feel embarrased by some of our sadistic ancestors who thoroughly enjoyed punishing criminals(many of whom were innocents by today's morals) as brutally as possible. As the [wikipedia page for capital punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment) enlightens and horrifies us:

>Severe historical penalties include breaking wheel, boiling to death, flaying, slow slicing, disembowelment, crucifixion, impalement, crushing (including crushing by elephant), stoning, execution by burning, dismemberment, sawing, decapitation, scaphism, necklacing or blowing from a gun."

Each of those methods has a wikipedia page of its own. Not recommended for the faint hearted. But its important to understand how innovative some of the architects of these brutal methods were. There was a consensus feeling that the longer the perpetrator's death can be postponed, more effective the method. They wanted the criminal to go through the excruciating pain for eternity. This would of course also allow maximum number of people to witness the event which would then inculcate the fear for that crime. It would also be more entertaining for some folks as witnessing bloodshed of society's lowest was one of humanity's [favorite forms of entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator).

But over the last few centuries, such gruesome acts have been thankfully abolished and most death penalties are by hanging, shooting or injecting the criminal with a lethal chemical. But much more recently, there has also been a concern over whether death penalty actually helps in making society better by reducing the crime-rate. 


I will start by laying down the common arguments that are put forth by defenders of capital punishment : 

1. Harsh punishments will deter future crime and potential criminals will know better before committing such heinous acts.

2. These criminals have inflicted so much pain on their victims, they definitely *deserve* to die. In some cases, relatives of the victim would even argue that quick death is an easier way out and the criminal deserves to experience immense pain before execution. This is what philosophers call [retributive justice](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-retributive/).

3. What could possibly be useful in keeping these criminals alive? They are an unnecessary burden for prisons and our tax money should not be spent on feeding them and providing "housing" for these monsters.


Now lets try to tackle these arguments one by one:

1. Lets just try and understand what is being claimed here. When there will be harsher punishments, the person planning to commit the crime will first reflect on the consequences like punishment before the act. After some thinking and searching on the internet for the exact harsh consequencing of his act, fearing that punishment, he will eventually abandon the project and go on normally with other important things in his life. Doesn't this sound ridiculous to anyone?

Thats not how the mind of a criminal works. Most of the crimes(like homicides, rapes) are often committed in an emotional state resembling fury or some kind of vengeance. In some cases, the heinous crime is just an unintended consequence which the criminal couldn't have predicted before the act. In other cases, there is no time for rationalizing the consequences of one's acts. This is especially true in the case of rape where negative consequences(if any) are usually quite distant than the immediate "pleasure". Furthermore, a [functional MRI study done on patients with antisocial personality disorder](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366%2814%2900071-6/abstract) concluded that systems responsible for reinforcement learning and decision making are altered in these subjects:

>Punishment prediction error signalling in offenders with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy was highly atypical. This finding challenges the widely held view that such men are simply characterised by diminished neural sensitivity to punishment. Instead, this finding indicates altered organisation of the information-processing system responsible for reinforcement learning and appropriate decision making. This difference between violent offenders with antisocial personality disorder with and without psychopathy has implications for the causes of these disorders and for treatment approaches.

Humans are known to think myopically. We are animals after all. For example, if I give 1000 rupees now or give you 2000 over the period of two years or more, most of you will go for the former option. Now some people might say that "its obvious that most of the criminals aren't thinking properly but who cares? They should know whats coming for them if they don't think properly!". Well, here the argument of deterrence totally falls apart. If you want to deter a crime by increasing the punishment, you absolutely want them to think clearly. But if they aren't thinking anyway, then it doesn't matter how harsh the punishment is!

Secondly, there is no proper evidence at the moment that tells us if capital punishment is actually useful in reducing crime rates. In fact, there is lot of counter evidence from USA. The state of Texas has had much higher rate of death penalty than other states for a long time and still the [murder rate](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state) over there is [1.5 points higher than states without any death penalty](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/studies-fbi-preliminary-crime-report-2012)

And even if one finds a positive correlation between death penalty and reducing crime, one also has to account for other factors such as cultural evolution and policy changes.  Since there are [many strange factors](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline) possibly playing a role in reducing violence and overall world crime has been anyway in [decline over the last few decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature), its very hard to find a specific correlation between capital punishment and decrease in crime. Moreover, we have been reminded time and again that [correlation is not causation](http://www.gwern.net/Causality), so we should always be careful before making  conclusions from any [evidence to the contrary](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/us/18deter.html?pagewanted=all). 

2. I have [mentioned before]({% post_url 2015-10-25-lackoffreeWill-benefits %}) my lack of belief in free will. As has been argued by many authors, the concept of free will [doesn't make](http://www.miketuritzin.com/writing/free-will-does-not-make-sense-as-a-concept/) [any logical sense](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/10/4499). Retributive justice demands that we morally hold the personal responsible for his actions.  At this point, I should quickly use an example to illustrate this point. Let's imagine that there is a serial killer who commits dozens of murders without feeling any empathy towards his victims. Eventually, he is caught and rightfully arrested. To test his brain, neuroscientists perform multiple MRI scans on his brain and [among other things](http://rense.com/general21/vio.htm) find that he happens to have a tumor in a region called [anterior insular cortex](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121024175240.htm) which inhibits his ability to feel empathy. This neurobiological recipe ends up creating a monster who enjoys killing people. Once the tumor is removed, the person gains back his ability to feel empathy and looses psycopathic tendencies. Now its obvious to me that most people would see him as a victim of biology. Goes without saying that without the tumor removal, he should be put away from the society but killing him painfully just because he "deserves" it, would be incoherent.  

All criminal minds are a byproduct of a mixture of their genes(that were inherited from parents) and their socio-economic environments of their past. And some randomness too. These folks were simply handed wrong set of cards in the game of life. Considering this into account, why would anyone think that the perpetrator "deserves" any form of punishment? Just because every criminal doesn't have a tangible tumor to detect doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong with the innate chemistry of their brains. They are all victims. They are harmful to society and hence totally needs to be locked up in prisons away from normal people but that doesn't mean they deserve experiencing pain/death as some form of retribution. If you don't get this point, wait for my post on "free will".

3. Third one is actually easier to rebuke because there has been quite a good amount of recent evidence suggesting that the money spent in the overall proceedings of a death trial is [much more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_debate_in_the_United_States#Cost) than the amount spent on a person incarcerated for life.
