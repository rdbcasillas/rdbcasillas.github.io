title: "Happy pills are invisible and almost impossible to trade"

People tend to enjoy acquiring beautiful things by throwing money at them. Be it a sleek car, latest apple products, apparels from expensive brands or even a beautiful "soul mate". This purchase, once complete, is supposed to make them feel better. But do these materialistic transactions really help them in increasing their happiness? Lets ponder on this interesting but now banal topic.

There are couple of obvious reasons why some people like to spend on aesthetically pleasing objects. One is that when a person is earning well, there isn't any alternative method as simple and straightforward as showing off your expensive possessions. The usual thinking goes along the lines of â€˜People need to know that I am successful or doing okay with my life and since running around with a stamp of my paycheck on my forehead will be a dick move, lets buy some things that give a signal of my money powers. This strategy works very well as others associate these beautiful objects with celebrities on TV and movies. So if a normal bloke seems to carry it, it should imply that the person is somewhat powerful. So they respond significantly  differently to this person if they seem him/her with a highly valued object. This also works because you can give false signals of being successful by saving enough money to ultimately buy beautiful things, even if it comes at the cost of making a huge dent on your savings account.  Secondly, adding a fancy object to your lifestyle will definitely make you feel better if it works out as well as marketed. Its expensive not only because the quality is better but aesthetically too it looks nicer than the cheaper quality objects. So the positive emotions induced by these products can train our brains to seek for them whenever we feel bored, frustrated or melancholy, creating a positive feedback loop.  

So why isn't [happiness](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/) solvable by applying the simple strategy of seeking and acquiring beautiful things. Problem is, we get used to it. We quickly become accustomed to using those items and this adaptation eventually brings the normal irritable things in life, back to the surface. So even if you notice your new pretty car turning a few heads, that positive feeling fades gradually by other more persistent worries. People you interact with on daily basis will not be awed every single day they look at your stuff. Attention will slowly come back to your personality traits like intelligence, work ethic and temperament. Its something you can't throw money at.

A popular suggestion in the past couple of years has been to spend money on experiences rather than materials. Learn a new skill, take a relaxing vacation or just hang around with good friends more often(if you have them). These experiences tend to stick with people much longer, increasing their average happiness and content overtime. Its easier and more enjoyable to remember a happy and eventful vacation than when the first timetime you bought an Apple product(although this might not be true for real Apple fanatics who feel high anticipation towards buying some of these products in turn making the act of buying itself a huge event in their lives). There are exceptions but usually memories become more enjoyable when we aren't experiencing them at all times. It makes sense to remember things that you are not constantly surrounded by. Objects once bought, usually tend to be with you everyday during your mundane life. Experiences tend to take you away from the humdrum of your life.

But this argument seems to  have a logical flaw. Most of the materialistic goods end up providing us great experiences. As I noted above,  the increased quality of the product can enhance the future experiences one might have using it. Taking a road trip across the country side might be a great experience but it can be made greater if you possess an open roof, high speed vehicle like BMW or Mercedes than a cheaper one like Camry. Same is true with possessing good expensive phones which can significantly enhance the quality of the time spent doing work or for leisure compared to a lower range phone that keeps crashing. These experiences might not stand out in our memories but on daily basis they do happen to bring comfort. And this brings us to the question of what exactly is happiness? Are there different kinds of it? If yes, what kind of happiness do people usually want to extract out of their lives? Is it the kind that involves experiencing pleasure on moment to moment basis or is it the one brought upon by remembering our past lives, which we use to judge the quality of our lives as a whole? Maybe there is a right mixture of both that people are usually striving for? These questions make this topic fascinating but also quite hard to answer, especially when you consider the variability in humans. Its unreasonable to mindlessly hope that what works for one person would work for everyone without understanding the exact need for the person seeking advice. In fancier words, we need to [beware of other-optimizing](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9v/beware_of_otheroptimizing/).

It has been argued over centuries by Buddhism and recently shown by couple of popular research papers, [a wandering mind is a unhappy mind](http://www.danielgilbert.com/KILLINGSWORTH%20&%20GILBERT%20(2010).pdf). This has further been [tested with fMRI scans](http://www.yalescientific.org/2012/05/the-healing-art-of-meditation/) of people practicing meditation, an activity where the whole point of the exercise is to stop this unfocused and sometimes bothersome wandering of the mind. So another skill people can use to feel happy is to become good at mindfulness which as I have noticed previously is not only hard to do on your own but also requires care if being taught in meditation centers. 

We waste so much time in deciding the perfect fancy object to buy. Once we possess it and start using it, within few weeks, it becomes like any other thing we previously owned. How can we expect something of this nature to bring us happiness? Or have we totally lost hope on achieving long term content and hence try to focus on never ending ephemeral positive feelings?
