title: "Meditation is hard"

---
On the surface, it seems silly to expect our brains to quiet down by moving into a thoughtless state. Millions of years of Evolution has architect them to think constantly. Thinking comes in different flavors with ever changing ratio between useful and not so useful thoughts. Yes, the thoughts that occur to us while reading, writing, solving a problem, playing, making love etc. are different. But more importantly the amount of unnecessary chatter that one thinks of while doing these activities is a direct function of the kind of activity and that person’s brain architecture. The intensity of these discursive thoughts(DT henceforth) increases especially when the person goes in an idle mode. Thought after thought keeps arriving without any particular intention. Meditation asks us to force ourselves into this mode and pay attention to it. You see, DT are always lurking around, even when we are engaged in an activity. Our engagements never really allow us to pay attention to DT’s true nature. With non-engaging activities like day dreaming, waiting in a queue, traveling to office, DT become more powerful and flood our brains with so much force, we think without even knowing that we are thinking.

Sitting down and asking our minds to pay attention to the breath or a single source of sound like white noise is like asking a dog to not look at it’s favorite cookie that is right in his food bowl. All instincts immediately start disallowing such absurdity. Without knowing you are moved from breath to DT. You become mindful and resist for couple of seconds by paying attention again but the mind immediately pushes back again. This back and forth happens for couple of minutes(maybe less) before you give up and allow your mind to take over with its eager DT waiting for this ludicrous resistance from you to end. And the next thing you know, the alarm rings signifying the end of another unsuccessful session.

Yes, Meditation is hard. It is supposed to be hard. Like exercising to build new muscles or getting rid of fat, it asks us to engage in an activity that our brain isn’t comfortable with. What makes matter worse is that there is no tangible positive feedback at the end of a single meditation session. This lack of reinforcement forces our minds to think of long term benefits and blindly hope that maybe something good will come out of this hard practice. Nothing might. You may end up crossing your legs and thinking for full one year without any noticeable benefits. But you might also end up experiencing states that only few humans have ever witnessed and acquire ever-present transforming set of lenses to view humans around. 

And hence curiosity is the primary reason that makes me motivated to try out this demanding personal experiment. What is the true nature of our subjective minds? How does it feel to lose the sense of self and observe the world without an ego? Yes, there are pragmatic benefits like better focus and healthier emotional states. And these will be experienced much earlier than the naked view of our minds. Still, I think of these as bonuses picked up while striving for the actual objective of experiencing true selflessness.
