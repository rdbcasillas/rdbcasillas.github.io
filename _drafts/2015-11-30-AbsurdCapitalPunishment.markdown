Over the course of this article, I will dispute most common arguments for death penalty, then consider few scenarios where death penalty might make sense and finally say a few words on what I think should happen with perpetrators of Delhi rape. 


>Severe historical penalties include breaking wheel, boiling to death, flaying, slow slicing, disembowelment, crucifixion, impalement, crushing (including crushing by elephant), stoning, execution by burning, dismemberment, sawing, decapitation, scaphism, necklacing or blowing from a gun."


But over the last few centuries, such gruesome acts have been thankfully abolished and most death penalties are by hanging, shooting or injecting the criminal with a lethal chemical. But much more recently, there has also been a concern over whether death penalty actually helps in making society better by reducing the crime-rate. 


I will start by laying down the common arguments that are put forth by defenders of capital punishment: 

1. Harsh punishments will deter future crime and potential criminals will know better before committing such heinous acts.


3. What could possibly be useful in keeping these criminals alive? They are an unnecessary burden for prisons and our tax money should not be spent on feeding them and providing "housing" for these monsters.


Now lets try to tackle these arguments one by one:


####Harsh Punishment will deter future crime

Lets just try and understand what is being claimed here. When there will be harsher punishments, the person planning to commit the crime will first reflect on the consequences like punishment before the act. After some thinking and searching on the internet for the exact harsh consequencing of his act, fearing that punishment, he will eventually abandon the project and go on normally with other important things in his life. Doesn't this sound ridiculous to anyone?


  >Punishment prediction error signalling in offenders with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy was highly atypical. This finding challenges the widely held view that such men are simply characterised by diminished neural sensitivity to punishment. Instead, this finding indicates altered organisation of the information-processing system responsible for reinforcement learning and appropriate decision making. This difference between violent offenders with antisocial personality disorder with and without psychopathy has implications for the causes of these disorders and for treatment approaches.

Humans are known to think myopically. We are animals after all. For example, if I give 1000 rupees now or give you 2000 over the period of two years or more, most of you will go for the former option. Now some people might say that "its obvious that most of the criminals aren't thinking properly but who cares? They should know whats coming for them if they don't think properly!". Well, here the argument of deterrence totally falls apart. If you want to deter a crime by increasing the punishment, you absolutely want them to think clearly. But if they aren't thinking anyway, then it doesn't matter how harsh the punishment is!






####The criminal "deserves" to die in pain


All criminal minds are a byproduct of a mixture of their genes(that were inherited from parents) and their socio-economic environments of their past. And some randomness too. These folks were simply handed wrong set of cards in the game of life. Considering this into account, why would anyone think that the perpetrator "deserves" any form of punishment? Just because every criminal doesn't have a tangible tumor to detect doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong with the innate chemistry of their brains. They are all victims. They are harmful to society and hence totally needs to be locked up in prisons away from normal people but that doesn't mean they deserve experiencing pain/death as some form of retribution. If you don't get this point, wait for my post on "free will".




####Don't use my money to keep them alive




####What do criminologists have to say

[A study done in 2009](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/study-88-criminologists-do-not-believe-death-penalty-effective-deterrent) which asked criminologists whether death penalty can have any deterrence had this conclusion :

>Nearly 88% of those surveyed said that having the death penalty in a state does not lower the murder rate. In addition, 91% of respondents said politicians support the death penalty in order to appear tough on crime – and 75% said that it distracts legislatures on the state and national level from focusing on real solutions to crime problems. Over all, 94% agreed that there was little empirical evidence to support the deterrent effect of the death penalty. And 90% said the death penalty had little effect overall on the committing of murder. Additionally, 91.6% said that increasing the frequency of executions would not add a deterrent effect, and 87.6% said that speeding up executions wouldn't work either.”[2]


###Is it ever okay to use it? 




In conclusion, I believe capital punishment's capital punishment is long overdue and we need to stop fooling ourselves by believing that it decreases crime in societies where its rigurously implemented. The dark angels of human nature are always lurking given the right circumstances and the solution is to try and curb their origin rather than beating one of them to death and hoping others will learn.
