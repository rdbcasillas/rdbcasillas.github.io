Essays are not allowing me to quickly write a post that consists of a small idea. The way I am collecting information for them
requires patience and structured research. But I need a place where small interesting ideas not supported by evidence
can be dumped. That's why traditional blogging is tempting. It not only pushes you to elaborate and reflect on that mildly 
interesting initial thought but also increases writing practice. Which is what I need at this point. Anything goes and my brain
will be free of the technical worries associated with my essays. Quality will take a low priority, making revisions 
unnecessary. 

The posts here could be as short as five lines. They will cover personal ideas, comments on someone else's interesting
ideas, opinions on books or essays or videos, [TILs](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/wiki/index) etc.
