A database that consists of smells of all kinds. Everyone has had an experience where they
say "this tastes like X" or sometimes fail to recall what the particular smell, smells like.
In instances like this, you simply access the smellDB through the mindweb which not only lets you
download available smells but also allows uploads of smells. Each smell is just a composition of 
different gases and converting them in a digital format turned out to be trivial (/s).

Applications include:

    * Dealing with frustrations of not being able to consume expensive food that the brain 
    originally associated the awesome smell with. Now you can just get all the similar smells 
    and their respective foods which  makes it easier to find the cheapest food closest to 
    the original expensive food. 

    * Trying to lose weight but cannot disassociate awesome smells associated with fast food? smellDB
    is here to help! Simply stream the smells associated with some of the disgusting foods while
    consuming fast food. Or just stream fast food smells while consuming a plain salad to provide 
    your brain with right feedback it needs while dieting.
