  title: "Can disbelief in free will make you a better person?"

Forgiveness. Hard to remember the last time I thought ‘I forgive that person’. This isn't because I have been unbelievably lucky to only interact with rational, kind and all loving section of humanity. <u>[Stupidity is evenly distributed](https://scourmanop.wordpress.com/2014/05/10/the-basic-laws-of-human-stupidity/)</u> and I constantly get my fare share of it. But the lack of forgiveness thought is primarily due to the fact that I don't *feel* much anger or contempt at people who act stupid. Why not, you ask?  Because even if there is an initial emotional response of frustration, I immediately rationalize it with my belief that humans don't possess  <u>[free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will)</u> and their actions are just byproducts of their historical environment, inherited genes and a hint of randomness. Although there are still a few loose ends that need tying, I have gone through this process of rationalization so many times that it has sort of hardwired me to not respond with a negative emotion. How could I possibly be mad at someone and then forgive them,  when I don’t even consider them as authors of their own actions? This isn't true only on the negative side of the spectrum of behaviors. The same logic applies to thanking a person. Although for the sake of politeness and giving positive feedback, I do say ‘thank you’ so that they know they did a helpful act and its appreciated, I don’t really *feel* thankful. It may sound as if I am operating like an android without feeling any emotions but that isn't really true. On the other hand, I have noticed that this thinking encourages me to help people without expecting anything in return. And this then brings a soothing calmness followed by a feeling of content. The reason to not expect anything in return is that the factors that would make them return or not are beyond me or that person. To be clear though, this doesn't mean I don't update my understanding of that person's nature if they happen to ignore me when I am in the need of their help. It would be stupid and more importantly inefficient to keep helping jerks(with no fault of my own I should add). In fact, on many occasions you clearly want to convey their mistreatment or irrationality for the sake of giving their brains negative feedback. This is precisely why its important to throw dangerous criminals in prisons. Its just that I end up holding no grudge against them for their behavior which allows me to keep my mind empty of unnecessary indignation. 

Another benefit of disbelief in free will is that it vanishes the feelings of inferiority and superiority.  You accept the fact that some people are more capable than others either because their capability growed in an environment most suitable for it or in some other cases, they inherited just the right amount of genetic code to outperform others. As one can imagine, disappearance of this comparison seeking aspect of our mind also helps in getting rid of emotions like <u>[envy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/envy/)</u> and pride. This doesn't mean you stop seeking self improvement. For example, self pep-talks can be a wonderful environmental input to motivate ourselves to achieve a goal. Getting inspiration from hard working creators is another useful environmental input that people consistently throw at their brains. 

But its important to be skeptical and ask whether we are necessarily better off by doing away with such emotions. There are numerous cases where people get motivated by these emotions instead as they drive them to improve their situtaions compared to others. This could be the exact reason why some of these negative emotions exist in the first place. Take envy for example. It can manifest itself in various ways but one instance is when people compare their status or performance to their peers or colleagues. Now if I happen to be a low achieving person, either I can simply accept my situation as part of some natural order or feel jealous of others bettering me. Since this negative emotion consistently bothers the mind and hence makes me miserable, the only way to get rid of it is to fix my current situation by working harder to overcome others. Evolution will select for this emotion because the humans who felt it will end up outperforming their rivals and consequently reproduducing more(this is all very speculative by the way). So there is a plausible way in which negative emotions can bring change for one’s own good. Same can be argued for a person fuming with anger and how that can have some benefits. 

I don’t have a good reply to such cases except saying that the ratio of suffering caused by them to the good that might arise occasionally, is in all likelihood huge. I personally haven’t met anyone who constantly gets motivated by such feelings. And even if they do acquire good things in life after experiencing this suffering(by being envious for example), there will always be someone superior to compare yourself with. Where does one stop? By exposing oneself to such emotions consistently, one cannot expect to suddenly switch them off after reaching a relatively higher "status". So on average, I believe they are harmful for an individual and societies will be much better without them.

Some people might worry that if they shouldn't hate people for their negative actions, why continue loving someone for their positive behavior? It can sound contradictory to not hate but continue loving for the aforementioned reasons. But fortunately, there is a <u>[beautiful asymmetry](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/free-will-and-the-reality-of-love)</u> here. Love is about caring for people close to us and feeling happy in their presence. Not only do these emotions communicate a positive signal to others but we also enjoy experiencing them. Hatred howerer, is completely dependent on illogical belief in autonomy of an indivdiual and more often than not ends up making the person experiencing it, miserable. 

So in conclusion, I argue that not only is free will an <u>[incoherent concept](http://www.pnas.org/lens/pnas/107/10/4499)</u>, belief in it can do significant harm to our mental health. Belief in it might have made sense millions of years ago when we were competing with everyone over producing more babies but in order to efficiently operate as a calm and altruistic person in the modern world, its best if we try to do away with this primal instinct. As Charles Darwin <u>[notes in one of his unpublished works](http://www.discovery.org/a/9581)</u>:

>This view should teach one profound humility, one deserves no credit for anything. Nor ought one to blame others.
