title: "Liberating voices of secular Muslims"

---


Why are liberals so afraid to criticize Islam? It is true that Western world has enforced horrible wars on middle eastern world but how is that related to the ideologies in Islam itself? The treatement of women, harsh sentences for apostates, hate speeches in mosques, these are not just happening in the middle eastern world. Islam has proliferated all around the world. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, Nigeria and other African countries where Islam is the major religion, have vast number of muslims. Majority of them are peace loving people that just want decent job and have nothing to do with extremists like Al qaeda or ISIS. But it doesn’t mean they don’t take their religion seriously. And unfortunately, there are things in the holy book that are not suited for the 21st century where we celebrate gender equality and freedom of speech. 

Now, its perfectly possible that majority in these countries would say ‘Please leave our culture alone, dont try to impose your western values on us.’ Well, thats fair. But what about thousands of muslims(minority) who do feel shackled in their culture? Authors, artists and activits who time and again get punished for raising their voices? Are we supposed to turn our heads and let them suffer? I am talking about cases like these(just from top of my head) :

I do not want to flood this space with links but just skimming through those posts will give you an idea of how senstive majority Muslims are to their religion and its associated values. This is not compatible with the world we are currently living in. Liberals need to understand that these events have nothing to do with Western invasion that resulted in collateral damage of thousands of innocents. They directly stem from a strong adherence to particular beliefs. And I am sure that there are millions of Muslims who disagree with such acts but just dont have enough power to raise their voices against it. Hence it becomes important to criticize some of these values and empower people from within Muslim communities who want to speak freely. 

Again, to be clear, nobody is saying that all Muslims think along this frequency. Infact, while working I had a good fortune of meeting a Muslim coworker who was sort of imitating the habits of a devout Muslim as closely as possible(long beard, five time prayer etc). But he was extremely tolerant about my views and listened to them without feeling offended. I obviously did not expect to change his mind over anything but it was satisfying to exchange thoughts on these topics without the fear of offending the other person. This is the change that I really look forward to all across the globe. 

It helps to keep in mind that socities that silence opposing views or out of the box thinking tend to be slow at producing innovation. Take Galilieo and Darwin for example. Both came up with outstanding theories that challenged the core Christian beliefs. The backlash at the time to resist their ideas was enormous. Former even spent a lot of time in jail for it. Now such reaction from societies(usually decided by leaders or ‘scholars’ of that religion) instills fear in other people who themselves have crazy or novel ideas to share. Its like a defense mechanism to impede future dissenting voices and it works quite well. 
We need to learn from these historical events and understand why its important to liberate voices in Muslim world that feel fettered. The whole world is celebrating Malala because she is standing up for education of Muslim women. The idea that someone has to fight for something as obviously important as education seems insane but it again stems from negative reaction from a very small society that takes its religion too literally(Al qaueda, ISIS etc). The whole world is with her because, you know..Education! But for some reason when it comes to critical thinking and freedom of speech - both of which should be part of education - liberals and multiculturalists tend to ignore the plight of Muslims who constantly live in fear after raising their voice(which includes just writing a blog post).
