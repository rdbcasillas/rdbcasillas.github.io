title: "Can disbelief in free will make you a better person?(incomplete)"

---

Forgiveness. I can’t remember the last time I thought to myself ‘I forgive that person’.  Primarily because I dont feel angry or pissed at people who act irrationally, which is just a fancier way of saying "act like jerk". Why don’t I feel any anger? Because even if there is an initial emotional response of frustration, I immediately rationalize it with my belief that humans dont have free will and are just byproducts of their environment and genes. I have gone through this process innumerable times and it has sort of hardwired me to not respond with a negative emotion(not completely though). How can I forgive someone when I don’t even believe they are authoring their own actions? Same logic applies to thanking a person. Although for the sake of politeness and giving positive feedback, I do say ‘thank you’  so that they know they did a helpful act and its appreciated but I don’t really feel thankful in the same way I don’t feel the need to forgive. It sounds as though I am operating like an android but I don’t see it that way. On the other hand, I have noticed that helping people without expecting anything in return brings a soothing calmess followed by a feeling of content. The reason to not expect anything in return is that the factors that would make them return or not are beyond me or that person.

Lack of free will also vanishes the feelings of inferiority and superiority. You accept the fact that some people are more capable than others either because their capability growed in an environment most suitable for it or in some other cases, they inherited just the right amount of genetic code to outperform others. As one can imagine, disappearance of this comparison seeking aspect of the mind also helps in getting rid of emotions like jealousy and pride. This doesn't mean I don't seek self improvement. For example, self pep-talk can be a wonderful environmental input to motivate ourselves to achieve a goal. Getting inspiration from hard working creators is another useful environmental input that I consistently try to throw at my brain. 

It won’t be fair if I don’t point out an important argument that can be used in favor of these feelings. There are stories in which people get motivated with such emotions and it drives them to improve their situtaion. This could be the exact reason why such negative emotions exist in the first place. Jealousy for example. It usually arises when people compare themselves to others arpund them. If I am low achieving, either I can simply accept my situation as part of some natural order or feel some minor contempt for others bettering me. Since this contempt or jealousy is a negative emotion harming my mental health, the only way to get rid of it is to fix my situation by working harder to become better than others. So there is a plausible way in which negative emotions can bring about change for one’s better. Same can be argued for a person fuming with anger and how that occassionaly can have some benefits. 

I don’t have a good answer to such cases except saying that the ratio of suffering caused by them to the good that comes out, is in all likelihood, huge. I personally haven’t met anyone who constantly get motivated by such feelings. And even if they do end up achieving something better, there will always be someone superior to compare against. And where does one stop? By exposing oneself to such emotions so often, one cannot expect to suddenly switch them off after reaching higher achieving state. So I still believe they are seriously harmful for an average individual.
