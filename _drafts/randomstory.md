Sipping his coffee in his favorite zero gravity chair that one would mostly see on beaches, he was contemplating and worrying about the future of the human race. Will we survive the inevitable artificial intelligence revolution? What about the threats from Islamic terrorists? What if they do get access to nuclear weapons? With advances in genetics, wouldn’t it be super easy to create artificial deadly viruses? And what about average person’s shallow idolization of stupid celebrities? It sounds trivial but all this energy(in the form of thoughts, time and money) takes time away from them learning about the real problems and wonders of this universe. These worries were so engaging that Global Warming didn’t even have an opportunity to beg for attention. There was also a faint voice that whispered that his worrying didn’t matter. He will never have a reliable way to communicate the possible solutions with anyone. He tried ignoring this whisper because he knew that thinking about such thoughts wouldn’t really qualify as worrying. There was a subtle sense of joy in thinking such thoughts, he felt. Its tempting to imagine that the human race that a person mostly despises, would eventually get destroyed by its own stupidity. He has had such thoughts before but it has been a while. Mundane office work and some funny co-workers --whose company he genuinely enjoyed -- had been keeping him distracted. Now that he was fired, there is all the time in the world to reflect. 

‘But seriously dude, what’s the point?’ another whisper interrupted him. 

He may write a book about it, he replied back to that apathetic voice. Or maybe write essays and publish them online. If he can come up with good solutions that convince fifty people, there is always a chance of exponentially increasing your audience online. Even if it was unlikely to discover or write something novel, he felt eager to invest energy in this exercise. Maybe there is a writer hidden somewhere. He chuckled after thinking that last thought. Self doubt will eventually creep in, he thought and then he would give up. Like everything else he gave up over the years. 

Few minutes later, he was already on the keyboard typing. Finished couple of sentences when the phone rang. Unsaved number. He tried to remember if he had seen that number before but only half of it seemed remotely familiar. But then his brain has the tendency to always feels familiar with half of any phone number it reads for the first time.
He pressed the green symbol on the screen. 

“Hello, this is Murtos”
“Hi, is this Mertos Geomber?”
“Yes, speaking. Who is this?”
“Thats actually not so important. I was just told to inform you that you will not regret writing about it. So please go ahead and finish whatever you have in mind. Good luck.”
“What? Writing what? Who the fuck are you?”
There was a short beep and silence. He looked at the screen and it was already back at the home screen. Hands shaking, he hastily moved his fingers to call the number again.

“The number you have dialed is currently switched of, please...”

“Fuck fuck fuck, shit fuck!” He tried calling couple of times more knowing in his heart that he would find it switched off. Wasn't surprised. But nonetheless frustrated and scared at the same time, he threw his phone on the floor while further shouting some profanities. Carpet flooring didn't allow the phone to break. 

Fear. Anxiety. Frustration. All these emotions were together making him frantically walk across the room. He sat down on his favorite chair again. Took couple of deep breaths to calm himself. After shouting ‘fuck deep breaths’ loudly, he stood up and started performing the same frantic walk. 

*************************************

‘Good job’ said the young fat man.
‘Who was this Mertor guy and what is he writing about it?’ asked the guy who made the call.
“Its Murtos. You will eventually know what he is writing...unless of course you die in the next 489 days.” 
“Hmm. Can I have the rest of the money now?”
“There you go. Go away now. Have a good one.”	
"I already had a good one."


It was a clean sunny day today. No more clouds that had been persistent over the last week. Murtos took another puff of his fifteenth cigarette since the phone call that shook him an hour ago. He felt a bit of a pain in his chest but felt calmer now. Some specific thoughts were of course still racing as if they were having a Formula 1 race amongst each other. He couldn’t follow any one of them for very long as some other one would overtake the first one within few seconds. What the fuck did that phone call mean, how could anyone know, did that voice sound familiar, what should I do next, were some of the thoughts that were leading the race. He stretched his memory as much as possible to recall if he had ever mentioned the idea of writing a book to anyone. How could he possibly have? He was certain that it was today that he thought about the whole thing for the first time. And even if it did cross his mind before, there is absolutely no one close enough to share such an idea with. And if it was someone I know, why would they cut the phone immediately and then switch it off? 

He had engaged in the pointless exercise of calling the same number maybe every time he had lit up a cig. He looked up the internet to confirm that it was a local number. That obviously was not going to help him. It didn’t matter if it was local or across the ocean. He was never going to trace it back. For a split second, the thought of calling police also tried leading the race but was quickly overcome by other more realistic ones. The only threatening conclusion was that someone could read his mind. Being a scientific person, it was impossible for him to believe that. Could it be the biggest coincidence in the Universe ever? Maybe a random person was just calling numerous people just to say this hoping it would be true in at least one case. Lot of people think of writing nowadays. But how can the timing be so perfect? 
“I was just thinking of writing it for the very first time, godamnit!”  he shouted in his quiet room. 

Suddenly he remembered that the person who called said he was told to inform him. Not much but it definitely meant that someone didn’t want to be heard. Maybe because I am aware of that voice?  He poured some whiskey for himself. He finished it in one gulp. There was a sudden urge to quickly get drunk. He poured some more. His glance went over the laptop screen. He opened the word processor, deleted the first sentence he had written earlier and started typing about this shocking incident itself. Maybe that would give his mind some relief. 

*******************************************

Rutsa had never seen a movie before on a movie screen. She was nineteen. This would have shocked most people if they didn’t know that Rutsa had also never eaten in a restaurant. She did have coffee and tea quite regularly but never any food. Weirdo, as everyone would call her. But she obviously liked it and was always on a lookout for a new antisocial thing to do or follow. She wanted this behavior to define her life. 

She opened the drawer of her cupboard and took out her favorite pencil. She has been using it for 763 days now and plans to continue writing her journal with it until she dies. What happens if she loses it? She stops writing the journal. Thats how precious the pencil is to her(or rather she wanted it to become precious). She of course has exceptions to this rule. Lost of the pencil doesn’t include a natural disaster or it breaking due to abrasion. She believes that special care would only come if the stakes are very high. This is what she wrote in her journal:

‘Today was not so good as yesterday. Which means I rarely got a chance to look different. I think people are getting used to my unusualness. Didn’t expect it to happen so quickly. Need to come up with new eccentricities. How about going bald? I have already experienced sex couple of times and it was not awesome or anything. I like it but its not something I will miss if it never happens for the next three or four years. My only fear is the reaction of Mum & Dad who would loose it their shit. But the amount of attention I would get from not just college people but also strangers would be immense! Definitely thinking about this seriously for next couple of days. 

Pasha was acting very nice today. Wonder what could I possibly give her. Need to avoid her as plague if she is planning to make a team of unusual buddies or something. Becoming bald would definitely freak her out. Would be too much for her too. But maybe I just caught her in a good mood.

I need to pay more attention to my Biology class readings. I wasn’t prepared today for the fascinating topic of DNA methylation. Could not contribute a single bit in the discussions. 

End of journal.’

Her writings were never long. She intentionally kept them short so as to write everyday. After revising it and making minor syntactical changes, she put the pencil back in the drawer. Then she typed the pros and cons of going bald for an hour. Pros were easily winning 6 to 2 but she won’t decide so fast. Although she wasn’t scared of doing it, it was big enough to give couple of days of thinking. 

‘Rutsa? Someone has come to meet you...Pasha?......Pasha has come to meet you’ shouted her Mum from upstairs. 
‘Coming up in a minute!’ Before running up, Rusta quickly added one more pro for going bald ..’gets you rid of Pasha’.

‘Hey Pasha, wasn’t expecting you. Whats up.’ she said with a well done fake smile.
‘Oh, nothing. Its..uhm..just that..uhm, can we go out for a walk?’ 
‘Yes but is everything ok? You sound a bit confused.’ 
‘I want to talk to you in privacy without ...umm...without fearing any intrusion. Its just that...everything is perfectly ok.’
‘Ok, lets go. Mum! Will be back in sometime!’
Rusta’s mum took couple of seconds before saying  ‘I was bringing some juice honey.’

That small delay was enough for her statement to miss out on her daughter’s ears. They had already left the house. 

**************************

‘Tell me, what is so secretive that we couldn’t talk in my house?’
‘This might sound a bit strange but..umm... I think ...umm... I think I want to know more about you.’
‘Ok...What do you want to know?’
‘I don’t know. Its just that I want to know more of you as a person....even if that means hanging out with you.’
‘Hmm..thats interesting. Do I intrigue you?’
‘Yes. A lot. I think there is a part of me which relates to you but is too scared to attempt what you do.’
‘Attempt what? What do you mean?’ Rutsa instantly thought that she would have to take out her precious pencil again. Maybe this day would not turn out to be so bad after all. 
‘Well, the way you behave, the unique and weird habits you have acquired. Its something I have always want to do but was scared to actually attempt it.’
‘But thats how I am Pasha, I am not pretending or anything.’
‘Really? I am sorry if that’s the case Rutsa but I see so many similar behaviors in you that I have imagined of doing  over the past few years.’ Pasha continued after an awkward pause in which they stared in each other’s eyes, trying to see the soul.... ‘It just seems you are always trying to stand in the crowd...even if it means a look of disapproval from everyone.’
‘I don’t care about people’s perception Pasha, I am not going to change just because they don’t like it. That is the real me! Accept it or fuck off is the motto I operate on.’
‘So can I hang out more with you?’
‘You are most welcome to. But the way you have been accusing me of pretending, I don’t think it would be a healthy relationship. My mother’s judgement is overwhelming enough.’
‘Look. Maybe I misunderstood you. But just because you are not pretending doesn’t lessen my fascination with you. I think I will become more learned and possibly wiser by chatting with you.’
‘I have no idea how this works. You ask me for permission and then starting tomorrow we start sitting together in class or something?’
‘I am not sure either. But I am getting sick of some of the girls I currently talk and hang out with. I need to change my atmosphere and I believe you are the healthiest person to be with at the moment.’
‘Well, don’t blame me if this idea doesn’t works out for you. I am not a bad person or anything but I can be really selfish sometimes.’
‘I don’t care and who isn’t selfish?’
‘Well, thats true...’

The strange conversation took a normal course for the next few minutes before they finally left for their respective houses. Rutsa would probably be writing a lot in her journal tonight. Her mind was racing with the thoughts on dealing with this unique and somewhat uncomfortable situation. Pasha....well... she would be immediately informing her gang about her success in convincing Rutsa.  


***********************

He felt drunk. The thoughts were still racing but at a much lower speed. He congratulated himself for not quitting drinking last year. It would have been devastating to break the pledge at this moment. His word processor told him that he had only written 300 words. Felt like he has been sitting for hours. He quickly went through what he had written, cursed loudly a few times and then deleted everything. Tried calling once more. It was off, of course. In order to avoid feeling completely useless, he pressed ctrl+z to get everything back. Again went through it. There were couple of interesting ideas in there but nothing that was particularly ground breaking. He continued writing for about half an hour more before the phone rang again. The ring was so startling, he almost spilled his drink on the keyboard. It was Sokoro. He felt disappointed as he was expecting the same unfed number. 

‘Hey Soko, how is it going?’ he asked with an enthusiasm which was easy to fake in the drunk state.
‘Oh hey Murtos. How are you doing? I was a bit worried about you. Hope you have been keeping up well.’ 
‘I think I told you that I am relieved that I was fired. I was thinking of doing something different anyway but was a bit scared to change paths at this stage in my life. I have no option but to work on something else.’
‘Well you can still look at some other company with a similar position.’ said a concerned sounding Sokoro.
A sense of irritation occupied Murtos’s mind, he felt like hanging up.
‘I am sorry man but I really don’t feel talking about it right now. Is it ok if I give you a call tomorrow?’
‘Oh sure, thats totally fine man. I am sorry, I should have messaged you before calling.’
‘Its really fine. I appreciate your concern Soko, you are a nice man. I will surely call you tomorrow.’

He shut his laptop screen and fell on the bed. He picked up his phone, looked at it for couple of minutes and then dialed Sokoro’s number. 
‘Murtos?’ responded  puzzled Sokoro.
‘Sorry man. Had a bit of a rough day. I am a bit drunk right now but what I am about to tell you is absolutely true and has no bearing on my mental state. I am not sure if I should tell anyone but I desperately want to feel better and drinking isn’t really helping.’
‘Go ahead man, I am all ears.’

Murtos told Sokoro. It made him feel better. A lot better actually because Sokoro gave him a wonderful idea. That idea will be exposed in few seconds. And as it will be seen(or read rather), it would involve bringing Rutsa in Murtos’s life.
******************

Murtos walked along the empty roads carrying his bike along. He had cycled for about half an hour now and wanted to enjoy the scenery by moving across it slower than what his minimum cycling speed would allow. Suddnely, the idea that Sokoro shared sprung back in to him mind. ‘don’t write anything’ Sokoro had said. ‘If they can read your mind, they know what you are going through, who you are talking to or thinking about, its all out there.’ Just thinking about what Sokoro said made Murtos so fearful, he parked the cycle and sat down for a while. ‘You decide to not write, they probably would call you again.’ Yes, it made sense to him. If someone really cared about me finishing a book or whatever and can also read my mind, they should call me if I decide not to. ‘Fuck you whoever you are’ Murtos said in his head. 

While watching(he could not really enjoy) the scenery and smoking a cig, lying on the ground, Murtos saw another biker approaching in his direction. As the figure became larger, it turned out to be a female. Larger still and it turned out to be Rutsa. She parked the bike near Murtos’s and started approaching him. Another stream of fear originated in Murtos’s mind and body, although it should be said that there wasn’t much in terms of feeling it as there was a constant presence of the previous stream of fear. 

‘This is for you’ said Rutsa handing out a small piece of paper to Murtos.
‘What is this? And who are you?’ Murtos replied as calmly as he could, even though he felt like running around like a mad man. 
‘I am Rutsa. But I have no idea of what this is because its a code language which you might understand I guess. But I was told to give this to you by someone. At least I am hoping you are the one he was talking about. I didn’t see anyone else with a bike for the past ten minutes. And you are bald, so it probably is you.’
‘Do you know the person who gave this to you?’ again a calm response but it was becoming impossible to hold his emotions. He felt they will burst out of his body anytime now. He had a glanced at the paper and confirmed that it was incomprehensible. 

‘Sorry Sir but I have no idea. The man looked tense and told me its important that his message reaches you. I asked him why can’t you just give a call and he said your phone is unreachable.’ Rutsa explained in a matter of factly way.

‘Ok. Thank you Rutsa. Can you still describe what the person looked like?’
‘He had brown skin and brown hair. Actually if I recall well, everything was brown, even his dress. That’s a bit strange, right?’
That is strange?! That is strange?! You have no idea girl whats going on so don’t trivialize the word strange...shouted Murtos inside.
‘Yes it is strange’ he spoke after what seemed to Rutsa a strange pause. 










They reached the location where the brown man gave the message to Rutsa. Murto looked around and scanned the place for a resembling face. Nothing. After doing this fruitless exercise, he realized how stupid of him to hope that the message would be given by a familiar face. 

Rutsa was getting impatient. She didn’t want to involve herself with this stupid fat man’s quest a second longer.  
‘Can I go now?’
‘Oh yeah! Thanks a lot Rutsa. You were very helpful.’
‘No problem. Hope you find whatever you looking for.’ 
‘Oh one more thing Rutsa. Do you recognize anyone in this place who was there the last time you crossed it.’ Murtos asked intensely knowing full well he is bothering Rutsa.
She looked around carefully. She saw the brown guy smoking near an icecream shop. He was smoking and holding an ice cream cone at the same time. 
Murtos’s eyes were fixated on her. He noticed the pause in her movement, especially the pupils. He immediately followed her line of sight and saw the brown guy. Wow, that was a jackpot. 
‘No, I don’t see anyone Sir’, Rutsa blurted. 
Murtos understood her fear and told his brain to shut up. His brain was of course asking him to push her to concede that she found the guy. 
‘Ok, thanks again Rutsa. Very nice of you to help me. Most people aren’t like that.’ Murtos added extra words to make her feel better.
‘Sure Sir, have a good day!’ she rode away.

‘Hello Sir, can I ask you a question?’
‘I am busy smoking and eating ice cream so unless its urgent, do not bother me’ said the brown man smiling. 
‘It is urgent.’
‘What. Is it illegal to consume both the things at the same time?’
‘No Sir. Just wanted to know who gave you this paper.’ Murtos showed him the paper. 
‘What? Who gave me what? Nobody gave me shit. You outta your mind man? Want some ice cream?’
‘Look. I know you are not supposed to tell me about this but I have found out about it now and either you help me or we go to police’ 
‘Holy fuck. Some balls you have man. Ok, lets go to the fucking police.
