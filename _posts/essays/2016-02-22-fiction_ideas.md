The following idea assumes that we have solved the <u>[Hard Problem of Concsciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness)</u> X years from now where I predict that X lies somewhere between 50 and 80 years. But even if this prediction comes out to be true, I still feel its one of those science fiction ideas that has very low probability of turning into reality. My understanding of how memory works is negligible and I will shamelessly make embarrassing assumptions along the way which would be easily discarded by some neuroscientist. But its fun to think about so here it goes.

When I talk about recreating the past, it is not the whole sequence of events. Instead its a finite number of snapshots from that event. Basically like different frames from a movie. With better virtual reality techniques, we might fill the gaps and add more elements in the environment to give an illusion of the the whole past like a movie but it will largely be fake. I would rather have high quality stand alone snapshots from the past than have those snapshots being part of a fake virtual reality.  

Now, imagine an event that happened in your past that also involved some other human being(s). So if you went for camping, imagine the ones where there were other people around you storing memories of that camping trip. The focus here is to recreate a few moments out of that trip. The quality of the snapshot increases with the increase in the number of humans involved in that trip because we have more memories to work with. Now, human memory is largely shitty. But <u>[memory consolidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation)</u> does happen and those are the memories you would want to focus on. Moreover, we can only create the events that we believe actually happened. If my friend cannot remember a single thing from the camping trip and even denies that he went to any such trip, the whole idea falls embarassingly. We don't have enough data to work with. So lets assume that she does remember it. We basically hook the brains to whatever machines we will be using at the time to observe the <u>[Qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia)</u> and notice the faint subjetive recreation in multiple brains involved in that event. Its almost like trying to get a better panaromic picture by taking pictures of a single object in the space from different angles. 

Its important to note that other subjects are very important because they also play a role in creating your own image associated with that event. You are not storing yourself(your body) when you are storing these memories. Although its probably much better to just throw your image through captured pictures of you from that era than trusting someone else's image of you from that era. But of course it will all depend on the quality of the Qualia.

Other than recreating such a memory snapshot, this tool would also stimulate the brain with relevant "keywords" to demand for more information, especially when available data isn't good enough to capture the snapshots. We have all memories of forgotten memories resurfacing again if stimulated with a set of input relavant to that forgotten memory. This seems to work even with events that happened a decade ago that were never thought of for a decade. This algorithm will have to use this feature of human memory to recreate missing information from the target memory snapshot. These keywords can be as simple as showing images of the camping place or asking the subjects questions relevant to that event. There is no reason to doubt that we will have a near perfect understanding of how memories are formed and stored. So assuming an understanding of the kind of questions that would re-ignite the lost memories doesn't seem like a stretch.

One can argue that a simpler strategy would be to just have a micro camera installed in(or near) your eyes that let you capture all the events of your life. This will definitely be faster to achieve technology wise than creating Qualia reading machines. Once you have such a recording, its just a matter of doing a keyword search for the relavant snippet in the movie of your life. Since tagging of events that are being recorded will happen along the way, it will be a simple matter of searching for tags like "Rakhi", "Camping", "Trip" etc. to dig out the relavant snippet. I haven't thought about the security and ethical implications for such a technology but I am sure better cryptography and elevated morality will allow us to overcome some of those barriers. So yeah, this is a great argument and maybe it completely mutes whatever I said above. But it wasn't as fun to think about!
