This is a site with pieces of writing on topics that interest me. These topics will range from fields as scientific as bioinformatics to as unscientific as philosophy. The blogposts will always be updated with new information whenever I come across new research or 
good arguments on the topic I have written on. The idea is to publish the most terrible, vomit inducing piece and gradually improve it to make it readable and hopefully make into something remotely close to [this guy's writings](www.gwern.net).
