An idea is composed of individual thoughts strung together. Sometimes this string looks beautiful to our minds but sometimes it is so trite that we ignore it. The human creativity is at it's best when it can string seemingly unrelated thoughts together. We see this in fiction novels where, let's say, the thoughts of "compassionate aliens from other planets" can be combined with thoughts of "evilness of wall street banking". Suddenly, you have a novel idea in the domain of "aliens helping humanity survive itself" (the domain itself, of course, is not novel). 

And since thoughts are very likely infinite due to constantly increasing information and entropy in this Universe, ideas are infinite too. And which means that we will never run out of "good" ideas. Moreover, human memory is so limited that we regularly celebrate rehashed old ideas. A little bit of thought into forgotten good ideas can make them seem great in current context. This happens all the time in fiction, music and even in a field as young as computer science. 

Now getting access to this infinite pool of good ideas isn't as simple as breathing air. You increase your proximity to this pool by engaging in activities like reading more, thinking more and having novel experiences. But most important of all, you need to develop an *appreciation* of novel ideas. You have to see them as individual entities in a story or in a piece of music/movie or in science and then notice what makes them stand out. This practice then helps you do the same to random thoughts floating in *your* head. It is possible that most people aren't even noticing novel ideas that their brains regularly come up with. 

Be conscious of and appreciate the bizarreness of your brain and you will be happily surprised that you are much more creative than you thought.
