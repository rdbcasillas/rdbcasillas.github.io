title: "Can disbelief in free will make you a better person?"

---

Forgiveness. I can’t remember the last time I thought to myself ‘I forgive that person’. Primarily because I dont feel anger or contempt at people who act irrationally or in simple terms, stupid. Why don’t I feel any anger? Because even if there is an initial emotional response of frustration, I immediately rationalize it with my belief that humans dont have <u>[free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will)</u> and their actions are just byproducts of their environment, genes and randomness. Although there is still some more work required, I have gone through this process of rationalisation so many times that it has sort of hardwired me to not respond with a negative emotion. How could I possibly forgive someone when I don’t even believe they are authoring their own actions? Same logic applies to thanking a person. Although for the sake of politeness and giving positive feedback, I do say ‘thank you’ so that they know they did a helpful act and its appreciated, I don’t really *feel* thankful. It sounds as though I am operating like an android but I don’t see it that way. On the other hand, I have noticed that helping people without expecting anything in return brings a soothing calmess followed by a feeling of content. The reason to not expect anything in return is that the factors that would make them return or not are beyond me or that person. To be clear though, this doesn't mean I don't update my understanding of this person if they happen to ignore me when I am in the  need of their help. Its stupid and ineffecient to keep helping jerks. In fact, on many occasions you want to convey their mistreatment or irrationality for the sake of giving their brains negative feedback. This is precisely why its important to throw dangerous criminals in prisons. Its just that I end up holding no grudge against them for their behavior which allows me to keep my mind empty of indignation. 

Another benefit of disbelief in free will is that it vanishes the feelings of inferiority and superiority.  You accept the fact that some people are more capable than others either because their capability growed in an environment most suitable for it or in some other cases, they inherited just the right amount of genetic code to outperform others. As one can imagine, disappearance of this comparison seeking aspect of our mind also helps in getting rid of emotions like <u>[envy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/envy/)</u> and pride. This doesn't mean you stop seeking self improvement. For example, self pep-talks can be a wonderful environmental input to motivate ourselves to achieve a goal. Getting inspiration from hard working creators is another useful environmental input that people consistently throw at their brains. 

But its important to be skeptical and ask whether we are necessarily better off by doing away with such emotions. There are numerous cases where people get motivated by these emotions instead as they drive them to improve their situtaions compared to others. This could be the exact reason why some of these negative emotions exist in the first place. Take envy for example. It can manifest itself in various ways but one instance is when people compare their status or performance to their peers or colleagues. Now if I happen to be a low achieving person, either I can simply accept my situation as part of some natural order or feel jealous of others bettering me. Since this negative emotion consistently bothers the mind and hence makes me miserable, the only way to get rid of it is to fix my current situation by working harder to overcome others. Evolution will select for this emotion because the humans who felt it will end up outperforming their rivals and consequently reproduducing more(this is all very speculative by the way). So there is a plausible way in which negative emotions can bring change for one’s own good. Same can be argued for a person fuming with anger and how that can have some benefits. 

I don’t have a good reply to such cases except saying that the ratio of suffering caused by them to the good that might arise occasionally, is in all likelihood huge. I personally haven’t met anyone who constantly gets motivated by such feelings. And even if they do achieve something better in life after experiencing this suffering(envy for example), there will always be someone superior to compare against. Where does one stop? By exposing oneself to such emotions consistently, one cannot expect to suddenly switch them off after reaching a relatively higher achieving state. So on average, I believe they are harmful for an individual and societies will be much better without them.

Some people might worry that if they shouldn't hate people for their negative actions, why continue loving someone for their positive behavior? It can sound contradictory to not hate but continue loving for the aforementioned reasons. But fortunately, there is a <u>[beautiful asymmetry](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/free-will-and-the-reality-of-love)</u> here. Love is about caring for people close to us and feeling happy in their presence. Not only do these emotions communicate a positive signal to others but we also enjoy experiencing them. Hatred howerer, is completely dependent on illogical belief in autonomy of an indivdiual and more often than not ends up making the person experiencing it, miserable. 

So in conclusion, I argue that not only free will is an incoherent concept, belief in it can do significant harm to our mental health. This belief in it might have made sense millions of years ago when we were competing everyone over producing more babies but in order to efficiently operate as a calm and loving person in the modern world, its best if we try to do away with this primal instinct.
