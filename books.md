A place to keep track of quotes, concepts and my personal comments collected while consuming a book. Hopefully this compression won't be as lossy as a book review and would better help someone in deciding whether a book is worth their time. An obvious personal benefit is to quickly review main ideas and quotes in a book while writing an essay or a blogpost on a related topic.
