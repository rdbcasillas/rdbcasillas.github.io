title: "Can disbelief in free will make you a better person?(incomplete)"

---

Forgiveness. I can’t remember the last time I thought to myself ‘I forgive that person’.  Primarily because I dont feel angry or pissed at people who act in irrational ways in turn causing harm. Why don’t I feel any anger? Because even if there is an initial emotional response of frustration, I rationalize it with my belief that humans dont have free will and are just byproducts of their environment and genes. I have gone through this process of rationalization innumerable times and it has sort of hardwired me to not feel anger(not completely though). 

How can I forgive someone when I don’t even believe they are authoring their own actions? Same logic applies to thanking a person. Although for the sake of politeness and giving feedback, I will say ‘thank you’  so that they know they did a helpful act and its appreciated,  I don’t really feel thankful in the same way I don’t feel the need to forgive. It sounds as if I am this cold person but I don’t see it that way. I have noticed that I enjoy helping people and the calmess that comes with rational thinking makes me help them better without judging them for how they accept that help. 

Lack of free will also vanishes the feelings of inferiority and superiority. Yes, some people are more capable than others but thats only because their capability growed in an environment most suitable for it and they inherited the right code whose phenotype is to perform that particular job better. Apart from the logical flaws, these feelings also tend to increase ego or jealousy in people. So there are also pragmatic reasons to do away with them. It won’t be fair if I don’t point out an important argument that can be used in favor of these feelings. There are stories in which people get motivated with such emotions and it drives them to improve their situtaion. This could be the exact reason why such negative emotions exist in the first place. Jealousy for example. It usually arises when people compare themselves with others in society. If I am a low achieving perons, either I can just accept my situation as part of things or feel some minor contempt for others achieving more than me. Since this contempt or jealousy is a negative emotion harming my mental health, the only way to get rid of it is to fix my situation by working harder to become better than others. So there is a plausible way in which negative emotions can bring about change for one’s better. Same can be argued for a person fuming with anger and how that occassionaly can have some benefits. 

I don’t have a good answer to such cases except saying that the ratio of suffering caused by them to the good that comes out, is in all likelihood, huge. I personally haven’t met anyone who constantly get motivated by such feelings. And even if they do end up achieving something better, there will always be someone superior to compare against. And where does one stop? By exposing oneself to such emotions so often, one cannot expect to suddenly switch them off after reaching higher achieving state. So I still believe they are seriously harmful for an average individual.
