On the surface, it seems silly to expect our brains to quieten into a thoughtless state. Evolution has worked for millions of years to architect a device, that is supposed to constantly churn thoughts. These thoughts come in different flavors but for a moment, let's characterize them binarily: useful and not so useful thoughts. Thoughts that arise while reading, writing, solving a problem, playing or making love are different, not only in content but also their effects on different part of the brain. More importantly though, the amount of inessential chatter or noise that one thinks of while engaging in these activities is also different. 

The frequency of these inessential thoughts seems to be a direct function of two things. First, the nature of the activity itself and how engaging it is for the person performing it. If the person happens to be in a [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology) while playing piano or writing a novel, for example, the frequency of these thoughts decreases.   

Second, the nature of the [wetware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_%28brain%29) designed by a person's genes and their [historical environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_history). An autistic person may have better focus while performing "engaging" activities compared to someone without that condition. A student who has been trained over the years (by parents or mentors) to study for longer hours, may perform better when it comes to disallowing unwarranted thoughts. 

The intensity of these discursive thoughts (DT henceforth) especially seems to increase when a person goes in an "idle mode". Thought after thought keeps appearing in consciousness without any particular intention. We are all aware of the experience of [daydreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daydream). Such states of mind are extremely fertile for DT. 

The practice of [Mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness) asks us to force ourselves into this mode and pay non-judgemental attention to it. As i mentioned, DT are always lurking around, even when we are engaged in an activity. These engagements never really allow us to pay attention to DT's control over us. With non-engaging activities like daydreaming, waiting in a queue or traveling to office over a memorized route, DT flood our brains with such force, we end up thinking without ever realizing that we are thinking. Its almost like someone has played a movie for us on the screen of our minds. Sometimes these thoughts can suck us into them as well as a great movie. 

Sitting down and asking our minds to pay attention to the breath or a single source of sound(like [white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise)) or just counting numbers with our eyes closed, is akin to forcing your dog to ignore its favorite cookie. All instincts immediately start disallowing such absurdity. The activities that our unconscious mind is so good at, don't deserve much attention -- let alone full focus -- from our conscious mind. You start the practice and within first few seconds, unknowingly, your mind moves from observing breath to some DTs. You notice this distraction and again try to become mindful by resisting this invasion for next few seconds but the DTs push back again. This back and forth happens for few minutes before you eventually give up and allow your mind to be taken over by a barrage of DTs waiting for the end of this ludicrous resistance. And the next thing you know, the alarm rings signifying the end of another unsuccessful session.

Mindfulness meditation is hard. It is supposed to be hard. Like exercising and running, it asks us to engage in an activity that our brain and rest of the body isnâ€™t comfortable with. What makes matter worse is that there is almost never a tangible positive feedback at the end of a single meditation session. This lack of reinforcement forces us to think of long term benefits and blindly hope that maybe someday something good will come out of this dull and painful practice. Nothing might. You may end up crossing your legs and thinking, session after session, for more than a year and not notice any benefits. But on the other hand, you might also end up experiencing states that only few humans have ever witnessed and subsequently acquire an ever-present set of beautiful lenses that transform the perception of your mind and rest of humanity.

And hence, curiosity is the primary reason that makes me motivated to try out this demanding personal experiment. What is the true nature of our subjective minds? How does it feel to lose the sense of self and [observe the world without an ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushin_%28mental_state%29)? How does it feel to feel genuine compassion for someone who is possibly the worst person you know of. Yes, there are pragmatic benefits like better focus and healthier emotional states that are marketed as primary benefits for exercising mindfulness. And these will probably be experienced much earlier than the naked view of our minds. Still, I think of them as bonuses picked up while striving for the actual objective of experiencing true selflessness.
