### Books

#### Started but Discontinued
* [Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World by Adam M. Grant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25614523-originals)

  Why do popular and apparently smart authors continue to fall for confirmation bias and survivorship bias? I 
	understand that they have to create a positive story but that doesn't have to be at the expense of 
	creating frustrating simplistic narratives. [This review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1558153316?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1) nicely captures many of my thoughts.

* [The Theory That Changed Everything: "on the Origin of Species" as a Work in Progress by Philip Lieberman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34889164-the-theory-that-changed-everything)

	Bunch of ramblings without a coherent narrative. Some interesting ideas here and there but not worth 
	reading if you are interested in learning about Darwin and/or Evolution.
