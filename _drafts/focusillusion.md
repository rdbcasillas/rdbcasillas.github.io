You are walking down the road and you notice a paraplegic along with their helper in your way. You become a little conscious and try to avoid eye-contact. Maybe you feel pity for that person. You think "What an unfortunate and sad life". Next, you notice a couple happily frolicking with their two beautiful dogs. You again force yourself to not look at that couple for too long. Over exposure of those images may hurt your ego or may force you to feel bad about your own life. 

This behavior of observing people and then instantly evaluating their state of happiness based on available superficial features, is a very human thing to do. This evaluation is followed by a comparison with your own mental state, especially if things aren't so great in your own mind. But when humans engage in this behavior, they fall into multiple biases and illusions.

**Focusing illusion** is one such bias. We tend to focus our attention on immediately noticeable differences while comparing two or more objects. When comparing someone super rich to a person from middle class let's say, our brain almost always tells us that the person with riches must be happier. Not true as it turns out. On average, there is only a mild correlation between income and happiness. But we only see whatever features of a person happen to be available for noticing and then assign higher weights to those features while evaluating happiness. In this case, those features could be beautiful cars or big houses.

It is important to keep in mind that this bias is not necessarily a bug in our thinking. It is simply a mental shortcut that helps us quickly come to a conclusion. It doesn't matter that on some occassions it's a wrong conclusion, if there are enough right ones. It is rather simple to see how it can this illusion can even help someone with low esteem to instantly boost their own morale. They just have to seletively observe the most unfortunate people in third world countries (this strategy doesn't work very often because we tend to compare ourselves with only people from our own social stratum).

So the next time your brain observes a superficially happy or sad life, notice that. Ask youself, what exactly about that person am I basing my judgment on?  What hidden features about that person could I be missing that could better symbolize their happiness index? Are there any superficial features in me, that when evaluated, will make people conclude incorrectly about my own mental states? 

Yes, all of this thinking is hard work. But that's exactly the point. You are not supposed to ask such questions by default. Unfortunately. without them, you will helplessly fall into the trap of constantly comparing yourself to others. Wait, let me rephrase that. Withou them, you will helplessly fall into the trap of constantly comparing the *best or worst you know of yourself to the worst or best you presume about others*.
