title: Effects of observing the world like a stand up comic
categories: blog

---

Its interesting that some generalizations or stereotypes made by 
comedians land on the audience well even though personal 
experiences couldn't have given them more than two or three 
instances of that particular subject that they make the joke
out of. Of course the quality of delivery is important and I am
paying attention to only the good comedians so there could be
incorrect generalizations made by a shitty comic that fall flat 
on the audience but there is still something fascinating about
minor observations that good comics make and hope that people
will relate to it. 

What is implicit in making people laugh on
not so common stereotypes or behaviors, is an advice for the  
world. Its this - You are all noticing funny stuff around you all
the time but you don't know that its funny until I tell you so. 
You all are so busy taking life seriously (and hence boringly)
, that you have become blind to the constant hilarity on this 
planet. 

Now I am obviously aware that this is hard to do for non-comics
because people don't expect normal people to find humor in 
normal everyday life but we don't really know what societal 
consequences would be if most people started doing in real life 
what some of these comics do on stage. The only 
way to find out is to teach this skill to a large number of 
kids and do a longitudinal study to observe the effects that these
subjects have on people around them. Do they become irresponsible
and less productive? Do they have less conflicts because 
people know whats coming and are always in "ready to laugh" mode
like how they are with stand up comics? Very hard to do this
with proper controls but it will be interesting nonetheless.
