#### Quotes/Ideas

On twelve big ideas that will be explored:

>you can’t appreciate them until you see what they can get you, but you can’t use them until you appreciate them, so you have to start with partial expositions that sketch the idea and then circle back once you’ve seen it in action, to drive home the point.

Emergence of eukaryotes:

>Then an amazing thing happened: two different prokaryotes, each with its own competences and habits due to its billions of years of independent evolution, collided. Collisions of this sort presumably happened countless numbers of times, but on (at least) one occasion, one cell engulfed the other, and instead of destroying the other and using the parts as fuel or building materials (eating it, in other words), it let it go on living, and, by dumb luck, found itself fitter—more competent in some ways that mattered—than it had been as an unencumbered soloist.

>This was perhaps the first successful instance of technology transfer, a case of two different sets of competences, honed over eons of independent R&D (research and development), being united into something bigger and better. We read almost every day of Google or Amazon or General Motors gobbling up some little start-up company to get its hands on their technological innovations and savvy, advances in R&D that are easier to grow in cramped quarters than in giant corporations, but the original exploitation of this tactic gave evolution its first great boost.

Forces that can enhance thinking:

>Over the years, trudging back and forth over the battleground, participating in many skirmishes, I’ve gradually come to be able to see that there are powerful forces at work, distorting imagination—my own imagination included—pulling us first one way and then another. If you learn to see these forces too, you will find that suddenly things begin falling into place in a new way. You can identify the forces tugging at your thinking, and then set up alarms to alert you and buffers to protect you, so that you can resist them effectively while simultaneously exploiting them, because they are not just distorting; they can also be imagination-enhancing, launching your thinking into new orbits.

Cartesian gravity:

>Cartesian gravity, unlike the gravity of physics, does not act on things in proportion to their mass and proximity to other massy items; it acts on ideas or representations of things in proportion to their proximity in content to other ideas that play privileged roles in the maintenance of a living thing.

Exaggerating stories to ourselves:

>Working with Nick Humphrey some years ago on what was then called multiple personality disorder, I discovered the almost irresistible temptation, even in Nick and myself, to exaggerate anything that strikes one as both important and uncanny. I surmise that whenever we human beings encounter something truly strange and unsettling, our attempts to describe to ourselves what we are experiencing tend to err on the side of exaggeration, perhaps out of a subliminal desire to impress ourselves with the imperative that this is something we ignore at our peril and must get to the bottom of.

Culture not geniuses move societies forward:

>Moreover, the traditional view of great human societies owing their greatness to the creative brilliance of (some of) their inhabitants is, I will try to show, just about backward. Human culture itself is a more fecund generator of brilliant innovations than any troupe of geniuses, of either gender. This it achieves by a process of cultural evolution that is as much “the author” of our finest achievements as any individual thinker is.

Designing without a Designer:

>The way to proceed is clear: start with the minimal specification for a living, reproducing thing—a list of all the things it has to be able to do—and work backward, making an inventory of the available raw materials (often called the feedstock molecules of prebiotic chemistry), and asking what sequence of possible events could gradually bring together, non-miraculously, all the necessary parts in the right positions to accomplish the job. Notice that this minimal specification lists what the thing must do, a list of functions, not a list of parts and materials. A mousetrap has to trap mice, and a can-opener has to open cans, and a living thing has to capture energy and protect (or repair) itself long enough to reproduce.

>Evolution by natural selection is not itself a designed thing, an agent with purposes, but it acts as if it were (it occupies the role vacated by the Intelligent Designer): it is a set of processes that “find” and “track” reasons for things to be arranged one way rather than another. The chief difference between the reasons found by evolution and the reasons found by human designers is that the latter are typically (but not always) represented in the minds of the designers, whereas the reasons uncovered by natural selection are represented for the first time by those human investigators who succeed in reverse engineering Nature’s productions.

On natural selection's similarities with computer algorithms:

>In Darwin’s Dangerous Idea (1995), I argued that natural selection is an algorithmic process, a collection of sorting algorithms that are themselves composed of generate-and-test algorithms that exploit randomness (pseudo-randomness, chaos) in the generation phase, and some sort of mindless quality-control testing phase, with the winners advancing in the tournament by having more offspring.

Differential replication is a special case of Differential Persistence:

>There is no differential re-production in the abiotic world, but we do get varieties of differential persistence: some temporary combinations of parts hang around longer than others, thereby having more time to pick up revisions and adjustments. The rich can get richer, in short, even though they can’t yet bequeath their riches to descendants. Differential persistence must then somehow gradually turn into differential reproduction. The proto-Darwinian algorithms of differential “survival” of chemical combinations can give rise to auto-catalytic reaction cycles that in turn give rise to differential replication as just a special case of differential persistence, a very special case, a particularly explosive type that multiplies its advantage by … multiplication!

Darwin and Turing:

>Both Darwin and Turing claim to have discovered something truly unsettling to a human mind—competence without comprehension.

>What Darwin and Turing did was envisage the most extreme version of this point: all the brilliance and comprehension in the world arises ultimately out of uncomprehending competences compounded over time into ever more competent—and hence comprehending—systems.

On elevator ontology:

>do we install a turnstile so that the program can count people getting on and off? Probably not a good idea. A scale that weighs the occupants together is better, easier, and less intrusive. Look what that does to elevator ontology: instead of having a “count noun” like “passenger” or “occupant,” it has a “mass noun” like “freight” or “cargo.” We can say, metaphorically, that the elevator keeps asking itself “how much cargo?” not “how many passengers?” Similarly, we can note that the polar bear doesn’t try to count snowflakes but is cognizant of the presence or absence of snow, or that the anteater slurps up a lot of ant on its tongue, unlike the insectivorous bird that tracks individual insects .... This is a nice intermediate case between a human being who memorizes—and hence literally represents in her mind, and consults—the rules that dictate her behavior, and the planets, whose orbits are elegantly described by equations that the planets “obey.” We human beings also often occupy this intermediate level, when we have internalized or routinized through practice a set of explicit rules that we may then discard and even forget. (i before e except after c, or when it sounds like a as in “neighbor” and “weigh.”)

Natural selection is buggy:

>One of the hallmarks of design by natural selection is that it is full of bugs, in the computer programmer’s sense: design flaws that show up only under highly improbable conditions, conditions never encountered in the finite course of R&D that led to the design to date, and hence not yet patched or worked around by generations of tinkering. Biologists are very good at subjecting the systems they are studying to highly improbable conditions, imposing extreme challenges to see where and when the systems fail, and why.

Do preys and predators "understand" the signalling:

>That is, the antelope may be entirely oblivious of why it is a good idea to stot if you can, and the lion may not understand why it finds stotting antelopes relatively unattractive prey, but if the signaling wasn’t honest, costly signaling, it couldn’t persist in the evolutionary arms race between predator and prey. (If evolution tried a “cheap” signal, like tail flicking, which every antelope, no matter how frail or lame, could send, it wouldn’t pay lions to attend to it, so they wouldn’t.)

Degrees of comprehension:

>At one extreme we have the bacterium’s sorta comprehension of the quorum-sensing signals it responds to (Miller and Bassler 2001) and the computer’s sorta comprehension of the “ADD” instruction. At the other extreme we have Jane Austen’s comprehension of the interplay of personal and social forces in the emotional states of people and Einstein’s comprehension of relativity. But even at the highest levels of competence, comprehension is never absolute. There are always ungrasped implications and unrecognized presuppositions in any mind’s mastery of a concept or topic. All comprehension is sorta comprehension from some perspective.

Free floating rationales are deceptive:

>We tend to see what we chose to do (a chess move, a purchase, parrying a blow) to have been just the right move at the right time, and we have no difficulty explaining to ourselves and others how we figured it out in advance, but when we do this we may often be snatching a free-floating rationale out of thin air and pasting it, retrospectively, into our subjective experience. Asked, “Why did you do that?,” the most honest thing to say is often “I don’t know; it just came to me,” but we often succumb to the temptation to engage in whig history, not settling for how come but going for a what for.
