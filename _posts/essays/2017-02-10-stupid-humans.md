We are largely a [stupid](http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2016/09/the_basic_laws_of_human_stupidity.html) species. By design. We are not supposed to use commonsense very often. Its time consuming. When apparent dangerous situations arise (which lead to a flow of extreme emotions), its better to not think and go by instincts. Since we are a social species, our instincts are largely composed of tribal instincts. Nobody can deny that thinking with these instincts is a decent strategy when it comes to our survival in the wild. Given some hundred thousand years or so, it was the best Evolution could do. But as we have also learnt over the past few decades, this strategy is also very buggy when it comes to our modern "non-wildy" life. 

This collective self loathing is inevitable once you glance over the field of Heuristics. Heuristics can be defined as algorithms that our brains use when making decisions. And what we understand now is that these algorithms are not designed to bring us closer to objective reality. They work just well enough to help us not die within few years of our existence (that's why natural selection selected them) but fall quite short when it comes to extracting the most useful information from our environment and correcting our own thinking processes. Somewhat ironically, the first set of people to understand these algorithms, were folks in the business of marketing and persuasion. They used this great knowledge extensively to manipulate their fellow humans into buying more stuff. 

Even more unfortunate is that even though Tversky and Kahneman came out with their groundbreaking ideas in early 1970's (see their paper [Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases](http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/teaching/Tversky_Kahneman_1974.pdf)), our education systems never realized the importance of imparting this knowledge to the next generation of humans. Easily one of the biggest blunders in the whole enterprise (but not surprising). I am ignorant about why exactly this blunder happened. The answer could be as simple as "incompetence and stupidity". But its hard to deny that when the purpose of the system is to "educate", it is bizarre to not educate the fundamental flaws in human thinking. Thinking is all we do. 

Year after year, we see stupid decisions being made at every human endeavor that involves thinking. And to be clear, these are not the domains or the decisions where we have to make life and death choices in an instant as is the case in the wild. We have enough time to reflect. But when the brain isn't even acknowledging and then understanding that something could be wrong with the default processing, how can it go about correcting itself even if given infinite time?  

Now more than ever, we need to aggressively market these ideas. We are running out of time ([maybe we already have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump). I am going to start playing my part by writing about some of the errors in the algorithms that our brains use for thinking. These errors are better known by their official name - cognitive biases. Yes, yes, I know what you are thinking. "There is enough stuff out there on these topics". "Thousands have articulated these ideas million times better than you ever could." But to impart this knowledge in a way that even a ten year old can understand (which is partially my goal), I need to understand it first. And one of the ways to understand it better is by [explaining it to myself as if I was ten years old](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/).  

So watch this space if you want to join me on this journey of understanding errors that initially started out as decent solutions to problems in life but then partially turned into parasites that seem to be doing more harm than good.
