With the advent of computers, medical technology has drastically transformed the ability of medical researchers 
to decode the human body. We not only have amassed details that were unthinkable in 1980s but our interactions
with these computers to better understand the human body have become so straightforward that even someone 
without a medical degree can learn to have these interactions. 

A computer science discipline that has provided immense excitement in recent years is Bioinformatics. If I have
to give one short sentence summary of what this field is, it would be : The unpacking of the ambiguous 
relationships between genes or proteins and phenotypical effects that we observe in animals. But I should also
add a caveat. No short sentence summary can do proper justice to the plethora of information that forms 
a particular discipline. This is especially true of Bioinformatics as will become clearer in preceding 
paragraphs. 

Imagine a disease a X. Its a terrible disease that causes thousands of deaths every year. Its inherited so we
know that unfortunate genetics are the most likely cause of it. How would you go about finding those genetic
components? Look at the genes of course! But which gene? And where exactly inside that gene? And what to look
for in that gene that would tell you something is odd? What makes something in the gene odd? 

These are the kinds of questions that Bioinformatics is consistently tackling. There are two kinds of
"Bioinformaticians" in this world. One kind, tries to create tools that help in not only converting the biological molecules (like RNA and DNA) into computer readable format in the form of "ATCG" but also write algorithms that aid in "reading" and "mining" these computer readable genetic elements. Once you have these
genetic elements in your computer, they become a pieces of data in a file like any other data (for example 
the contents of this article). Manipulation of this data is what many Bioinformaticians do to gain insight
into possible patterns that may be present in a person's genome. It could be a pattern that symbolises a 
Cancer patient or a pattern that highlights mutations in a person suffering from Alzheimers disease. 

I am a Bioinformatician and among other things my job is to find patterns in the genomes of patients suffering
from blood related diseases. My findings of a particular mutation or lack of an important piece of a gene can 
help clinicians to address that defect by attacking the problem at its core. It also helps physicians to better
understand the disease and explain to their patients the root cause of the disease. 

Lets take an example that I will simplify for understanding purposes. 
Suppose a patient with diabetes gets their genome sequenced. The 
purpose is of course to find the patterns that will help us answer the question : what "diabetes" really mean 
at the genetic level? Bioinformaticians will do their analysis on this genome and compare it with a healthy 
person's genome. You can't compare the whole genome because many regions will be irrelevant to the regions that
are involved in diabetes. This filtered focus on specific regions can give us a good picture of what diabetes 
looks like. And if another diabetic patient shows similar patterns then we would have found a potential region
that can be targeted to treat diabetes.
