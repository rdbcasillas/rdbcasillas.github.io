Monthly collection of readings discovered on the web that contain interesting ideas. These are usually long articles and/or journal papers (less occasionally short blogposts and insightful comments on forums). The categories that separate them are not consistent and may vary every month depending on the content I happen to
land upon. Some of the content can fall into multiple categories but I am throwing them under one based on my immediate thoughts after finishing it, instead of ruminating.
