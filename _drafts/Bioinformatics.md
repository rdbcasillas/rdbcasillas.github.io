With the advent of computers, medical technology has drastically transformed the ability of medical researchers 
to decode the human body. We not only have amassed details that were unthinkable in 1980s but our interactions
with these computers to better understand the human body have become so straightforward that even someone 
without a medical degree can learn to have these interactions. 

A computer science discipline that has provided immense excitement in recent years is Bioinformatics. If I have
to give one short sentence summary of what this field is, it would be : The unpacking of the ambiguous 
relationships between genes or proteins and phenotypical effects that we observe in animals. But I should also
add a caveat. No short sentence summary can do proper justice to the plethora of information that forms 
a particular discipline. This is especially true of Bioinformatics as will become clearer in preceding 
paragraphs. 

Imagine a disease a X. Its a terrible disease that causes thousands of deaths every year. Its inherited so we
know that unfortunate genetics are the most likely cause of it. How would you go about finding those genetic
components? Look at the genes of course! But which gene? And where exactly inside that gene? And what to look
for in that gene that would tell you something is odd? What makes something in the gene odd? 

These are the kinds of questions that Bioinformatics is consistently tackling. There are two kinds of
"Bioinformaticians" in this world. One kind, tries to create tools that help in not only converting the biological molecules into computer readable format but also write algorithms that aid in "reading" and "mining"
the this computer readable genome.
