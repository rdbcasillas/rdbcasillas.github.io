Collection of important readings on the web that contain useful and interesting ideas. These are largely long articles and occasionally journal papers(and less occasionally short blogposts or insightful comments) that I come across while surfing the web casually or with a purpose. The categories I list below will probably change every month depending on the content I come across. Since some of these articles can fall into multiple categories, I am throwing them in one section based on my initial reaction and thoughts after reading it, instead of ruminating about it.
