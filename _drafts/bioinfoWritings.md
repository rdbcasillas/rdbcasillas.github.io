List some bioinformatics blogs and the need that they serve
Mention the element that's lacking, maybe none of them regularly discusses bioinfo papers.
occasional playing around with available data to display learning or comparisons of new tools.

I am on my way to become a bioinformatician. The debate on what the field of bioinformatics consists of and how to precisely define it is still ongoing. But I agree with X that a bioinformatician's job can range from this to that. So maybe the inability to have a 
concise definition for this field isn't that problematic. What we do know is the kinds of skills that a person needs to acquire in order to call themselves a bioinformatician. And the list of skills is always expanding so maybe the definitions will keep expanding
in the future too to be inclusive of those skills

There are many interesting blogs that cover this field in their own unique ways. You have x doing this, y doing that, z focusing on only this. Authors of these blogs seem highly qualified and sometimes their posts can be daunting to understand. Sometimes they are 
discussing new techniques. But there is a lack of place that discusses old but useful papers in this field that can act as a good introduction for someone new to this convoluted field. There are thousands of different concepts to grasp from fields like this and that.

What is also lacking is a site that explains new tools by running small datasets on them. We do have places explaining tools but they are usually unengaging as they lack some sort of story telling. Learning through biostars or seqanswers is good but sometimes the 
lack of structure can make things seem more overwhelming than they actually might be. In order to fill this apparent void, I am planning to try an experiment of writing few posts in this field. I am not clear on how the exploration of paper will make things 
more interesting for new comers to this field but it is clear to me that this experiment needs to be tried. Since I am not proficient in this field, I am planning to learn along the way and hopefully my view of this field as a newbie will provide new insights into
teaching this field. At this point, I am very comfortable of failure since I have nothing to loose by trying this. 

For example a paper explaining different kinds of variations: copy, structural, germline, somatic etc can be a good reference for explaining these basic introductory concepts. Papers obviously suck and many prefer to read blog posts. Another paper could be the one comparing performances of different aligners or variant callers. Analysis on small set of genes can easily be done for the purpose of the blog and hence introducing these tools to newbies. The blog of course needs to have good references so the reader can read about the concept in further detail. There should be a structure to the presentation of these posts so its easier for the visitor to traverse across bunch of posts. Maybe something like LW's sequences.

Now all this can take significant time and effort. I don't expect to have quality posts to be ready before a month. But as a starting point, a post every month shouldn't be too bad. I have other more important things to focus on.
