On the surface, it seems silly to expect our brains to quiet down by moving into a thoughtless state. Millions of years of Evolution has architect them to think constantly. Thinking comes in different flavors with ever changing ratio between useful and not so useful thoughts. Now the thoughts that occur to us while reading, writing, solving a problem, playing, making love etc. are different in content. But more importantly, the amount of unnecessary chatter or noise that one thinks of while engaging in these activities is also different. The frequency of these unrelated thoughts happens to be a direct function of two things. First, the nature of the activity being performed and how engaging it happens to be for that person. Second, the nature of <u>[wetware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_%28brain%29)</u> designed by person's genes and their historical environment. Someone with autism will obviously have better focus while performing "engaging" activities compared to the non-autistic person. The intensity of so called discursive thought(DT henceforth) increases especially when the person goes in an idle mode. Thought after thought keeps appearing without any particular intention. We all know what <u>[daydreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daydream)</u> looks like. The practice of <u>[Mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness)</u> asks us to force ourselves into this mode and pay attention to it. You see, DT are always lurking around, even when we are engaged in an activity. These engagements never really allow us to pay attention to DT's control over us. With non-engaging activities like daydreaming, waiting in a queue, traveling to office, DT flood our brains with such force, we end up thinking without ever realizing that we are thinking. Its almost like someone has played a movie for us on the screen of our minds. Sometimes these thoughts can suck us into them as well as a great movie. 

Sitting down and asking our minds to pay attention to the breath or a single source of sound(like <u>[white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise)</u>) or just counting numbers with our eyes closed, is akin to forcing your dog to ignore its favorite cookie. All instincts immediately start disallowing such absurdity. The activities that our unconscious mind is so good at, don't deserve much attention -- let alone full focus -- from our conscious mind. You start the practice and within first few seconds, unknowingly, your mind moves from observing breath to some DTs. You notice this distraction and again try to become mindful by resisting this invasion for next few seconds but the DTs push back again. This back and forth happens for few minutes before you eventually give up and allow your mind to be taken over by a barrage of DTs waiting for the end of this ludicrous resistance. And the next thing you know, the alarm rings signifying the end of another unsuccessful session.

Mindfulness meditation is hard. It is supposed to be hard. Like exercising and running, it asks us to engage in an activity that our brain and rest of the body isnâ€™t comfortable with. What makes matter worse is that there is almost never a tangible positive feedback at the end of a single meditation session. This lack of reinforcement forces us to think of long term benefits and blindly hope that maybe someday something good will come out of this dull and painful practice. Nothing might. You may end up crossing your legs and thinking, session after session, for more than a year and not notice any benefits. But on the other hand, you might also end up experiencing states that only few humans have ever witnessed and subsequently acquire an ever-present set of beautiful lenses that transform the perception of your mind and rest of humanity.

And hence, curiosity is the primary reason that makes me motivated to try out this demanding personal experiment. What is the true nature of our subjective minds? How does it feel to lose the sense of self and <u>[observe the world without an ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushin_%28mental_state%29)</u>? How does it feel to feel genuine compassion for someone who is possibly the worst person you know of. Yes, there are pragmatic benefits like better focus and healthier emotional states that are marketed as primary benefits for exercising mindfulness. And these will probably be experienced much earlier than the naked view of our minds. Still, I think of them as bonuses picked up while striving for the actual objective of experiencing true selflessness.
