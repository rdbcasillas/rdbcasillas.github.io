title: "Absurdity of Capital Punishment"

---


With the recent celebrations on court's decision regarding the Delhi gang-rape, I think this country is in dire need to understand how useless and unethical this whole concept is and why we need to be more rational whenever discussing about it. Over the course of this article, I will dispute most common arguments for death penalty, then consider few scenarios where death penalty might make sense and finally say a few words on what I think should happen with perpetrators of Delhi rape. 

Over the history of justice systems in various human societies, death penalty has played a consistent role. Its hard not to feel embarrased by some of our sadistic ancestors who thoroughly enjoyed punishing criminals(many of whom were innocents by today's morals) as brutally as possible. As the [wikipedia page for capital punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment) enlightens and horrifies us:

>Severe historical penalties include breaking wheel, boiling to death, flaying, slow slicing, disembowelment, crucifixion, impalement, crushing (including crushing by elephant), stoning, execution by burning, dismemberment, sawing, decapitation, scaphism, necklacing or blowing from a gun."

Each of those methods has a wikipedia page of its own. Not recommended for the faint hearted. But its important to understand how innovative some of the architects of these brutal methods were. There was a consensus feeling that the longer the perpetrator's death can be postponed, more effective the method. They wanted the criminal to go through the excruciating pain for eternity. This would of course also allow maximum number of people to witness the event which would then inculcate the fear for that crime. It would also be more entertaining for some folks as witnessing bloodshed of society's lowest was one of humanity's [favorite forms of entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator).

But over the last few centuries, such gruesome acts have been thankfully abolished and most death penalties are by hanging, shooting or injecting the criminal with a lethal chemical. But much more recently, there has also been a concern over whether death penalty actually helps in making society better by reducing the crime-rate.


I will start by laying down the common arguments that are put forth by defenders of capital punishment : 

1. Harsh punishments will deter future crime and potential criminals will know better before committing such heinous acts.

2. These criminals have inflicted so much pain on their victims, they definitely deserve to die. In some cases, relatives of the victim would even argue that quick death is an easier way out and the criminal deserves to experience immense pain before execution. This is what philosophers call [retributive justice](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-retributive/).

3. What could possibly be useful in keeping these criminals alive? They are an unnecessary burden for prisons and our tax money should not be spent on feeding them and providing "housing" for these monsters.


Now lets try to tackle these arguments one by one:

1. Lets just try and understand what is being claimed here. When there will be harsher punishments, the person planning to commit the crime will first reflect on the consequences like punishment before the act. After some thinking and searching on the internet for the exact harsh consequencing of his act, fearing that punishment, he will eventually abandon the project and go on normally with other important things in his life. Doesn't this sound ridiculous to anyone?

Thats not how the mind of a criminal works. Most of the crimes(like homicides, rapes) are often committed in an emotional state resembling fury or some kind of vengeance. In some cases, the heinous crime is just an unintended consequence which the criminal couldn't have predicted before the act. In other cases, there is no time for rationalizing the consequences of one's acts. This is especially true in the case of rape where negative consequences(if any) are usually quite distant than the immediate "pleasure". Furthermore, a [functional MRI study done on patients with antisocial personality disorder](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366%2814%2900071-6/abstract) concluded that systems responsible for reinforcement learning and decision making are altered in these subjects:

>Punishment prediction error signalling in offenders with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy was highly atypical. This finding challenges the widely held view that such men are simply characterised by diminished neural sensitivity to punishment. Instead, this finding indicates altered organisation of the information-processing system responsible for reinforcement learning and appropriate decision making. This difference between violent offenders with antisocial personality disorder with and without psychopathy has implications for the causes of these disorders and for treatment approaches.

Humans are known to think myopically. We are animals after all. For example, if I give 1000 rupees now or give you 2000 over the period of two years or more, most of you will go for the former option. Now some people might say that "its obvious that most of the criminals aren't thinking properly but who cares? They should know whats coming for them if they don't think properly!". Well, here the argument of deterrence totally falls apart. If you want to deter a crime by increasing the punishment, you absolutely want them to think clearly. But if they aren't thinking anyway, then it doesn't matter how harsh the punishment is!

Secondly, there is no proper evidence at the moment that tells us if capital punishment is actually useful in reducing crime rates. In fact, there is lot of counter evidence from USA. The state of Texas has had much higher rate of death penalty than other states for a long time and still the [murder rate](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state) over there is [1.5 points higher than states without any death penalty](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/studies-fbi-preliminary-crime-report-2012)

Also, even if one finds a positive correlation between death penalty and reducing crime, one also has to account for other factors such as culture, religion etc. There are so many factors playing a role in reducing crime that its very hard to find evidence(in form of decent research) for death penalty causing it. Correlation is not causation ! (To checkout some improper evidence which links to death penalty having deterrence effect, read this :
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/us/18deter.html?pagewanted=all )

2. Now this one can take a whole new essay to explain. What this one argues for is the concept of retribution which doesn't make any sense. Imagine there is a serial killer who has committed dozens of murder and really enjoyed doing them. He was arrested and his examination showed that he has a tumor in his brain which inhibits his capability of feeling empathy and makes him violent. If the tumor is removed, he will live a perfectly healthy life like a normal person. Now most people would easily see him victim of biology in this case. "Poor fellow had a tumor which made him do bad things." 
My point is this. All the criminal minds are created either because of their genes or because of their socio-economic/childhood environment. They are just unlucky folks who happen to have brain of a rapist/psychopath. Having a tumor is just a special case of this. Now, considering this into account, why would anyone think that the perpetrator "deserves" some punishment is beyond me. Just because every criminal doesn't have a tangible tumor to detect doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong with the innate chemistry of their brains. They are all victims. They are harmful to society and hence totally needs to be locked up in prisons away from normal people but that doesn't mean they deserve experiencing pain/death as some form of retribution. If you don't get this point, wait for my post on "free will".

3. Third one is actually easier to rebuke because there has been quite a good amount of recent evidence suggesting that the money spent in the overall proceedings of a death trial is much more than the amount spent on a person incarcerated for life. For more information on this, check this :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_debate_in_the_United_States#Cost

Now these are the two scenarios(that rarely happen) where death penalty might make sense:

1.Imagine a psychopath who has committed 15-20 murders. He is finally captured and sentenced to life imprisonment. Psychologists collect data from him to improve understanding of such people's mind(a few brain scans like MRI too).Finally he is told to work in jail and produce something for prison society. His need to kill doesn't stop though and he ends up killing 2-3 people in jail too. Now he is sent to some different jail in isolation. More studies on him are done and finally its decided that the changes in his brain are irreversible. And keeping him alive securely in isolation will cost too much tax money. In this case, it might be perfectly rational to put him to sleep. 

2.High profile terrorists of groups like Al-Qaeda and Taliban, if captured surely should be put to death once all the interrogation(which is mostly useless) is over. These people can trigger dangerous hijacks by members of their own groups(of planes or whatever) and can get freed as a blackmail. 

  
What we could do with Delhi rapists if not death penalty ?
We need to collect as much data as possible by trying to understand their psychology. Rape problem will be solved by focusing at grass root level and there is no quick-fix. This data will make us answer questions such as "What sort of childhood did they have ?", "Did they feel any guilt after doing this ?", "How do they perceive women's role in society ?". Such questions can thus help us to educate teenagers(especially in rural areas) about importance of respecting women and also on how to control their urges. Nobody is saying this is an easy job, this is a long term solution in order to change the "mindset" of majority of men in this country. We obviously need better policing as a short term fix.
Once the data has been collected, they should be made to work inside jails to produce something useful for prisoners. Giving them pain or killing them is pointless for the above mentioned reasons. They have done a ghastly crime and I am not saying anything about releasing them from prison.	 

p.s. : I am sure some people will disagree with my thoughts and I would welcome constructive criticism. Apart from just disagreeing, also try to point where I am wrong so that I can correct those thoughts in an updated post.
