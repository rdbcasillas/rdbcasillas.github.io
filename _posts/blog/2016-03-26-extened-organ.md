title: Cellphones are extended organs

---

Mobile phones are part of ourselves. Almost like an extended organ. Proper
functioning of this organ is obviously important to us but more interestingly its 
important to emotional health people close to us. If it doesn't work for extended 
period of time, our temporary unreachability induces fear in closed ones. If the 
connection isn't right or our voices cannot be heard correctly, that induces 
irritation or frustration in closed ones. Buying a shinier one can even
be used to display our monetory health, hence playing a minor role in sexual
selection (although that can be said of any personal costly object).

It used to be a tool just like any other humanity invented and enjoyed. 
But its not just a tool anymore. Its one of our organs which we need to take care of
by keeping it safe and upgrading to better versions.
