Numerous articles have been written in the last year on the irrelevance of facts. The whole election cycle, many journalists wondered why Donald
Trump supporters are not paying attention to the Truth. The phenomenon was so widespread that Oxford Dictionaries declared "post-truth" as the word of
the year. All this brings us to the question of why this happened in the first place? Now we can answer this question in two ways. Either by looking
into proximate causes or digging out the ultimate cause if any.

Proximate causes tell us about the immediate reasons involved in a particular outcome. 
Ultimate causes

Focus has always been on proximate causes.
Argumentative theory argues that post truth is exactly what Evolution wanted.
We just happen to have enough overlap between Truth and Good Arguments. But 
whenever Truth conflicts with basal human emotions arising from tribalism, it 
will loose.
